# What is VITAL

Vital is a magazine focused on experimental electronic music. It started in 1987 as magazine on paper. It's simple xeroxed form ensured a free copyright and everybody was encouraged to make copies and distribute them freely. Up until 1995 44 issues were made and with the arrival of the Internet, Vital changed into a pure e-mail review newsletter and since then it appears weekly. Still as a free service and still without copyright. [Here](http://vitalweekly.net/) is the current vital website. Some of the issues are also archived in [IISG Amsterdam](https://hdl.handle.net/10622/B243EE91-F43C-4C88-9B1D-9E346CA715BA).

02:22 So well oh... I will just... I like to talk so don't worry 02:27

02:28 Ok haha I am not worried 02:28 ***Y\***

02:28 Uhm... Before this thing... Before Vital... I did this other magazine called null-null, which is... In dutch means zero-zero. It has nothing to do with the dutch art movement called zero. Or club null I think it was called in the 60s. And uhm... this was, this one is from 1986. And I made this with a friend of mine - Christian uhm... long dead now. And is very simple typed with a typewriter. One sided 03:19

03:17 So when did u start doing this. 03:19**D**

03:19 In 1986. 03:22

03:21 And how old were you at that time?03:23 **D**

03:23 Uhm... 21.03:28

03:28 Oh, sweet! Like my age 03:28 **Y**

03:27 Yeah.. yeah.. And uh so then.. And this was also connected to the world of mail art.03:43

03:43 Oh thats what we also thought 03:43 **D**

03:45 And stuff like this... Every issue had its own piece of mail art. But it was also a magazine that in those days people will send in stuff. Already typed out and with an image

and stuff like that. You can see where the fonts changes this is my typewriter and this is my dad's typewriter. Uhm... This is my dad typewrite but then somebody else gave me this article about industrial music in Belgium. So as you is a different typewriter. So I was collecting this stuff and then I did this one... I wanted to do more magazines I realised was a bit difficult, but I really wanted to do this James bond thing. So 007. Which is actually issue #3. And this is stensil print which is the ancestor of risoprint.04:42

04:43 Ah yess we have riso print at school also.04:43

04:44 The previous version is a stensil print. This is the first time I worked with this people (the place where the workshop will take place) I think also in 1986. It was may 86 I guess. Still smudging. And uhm so I know this people since those days so 24 years now. And then I realised... then the last one was 00 #10. With the old dutch banknote for 1000 gildas.05:23

05:23 So is this like a master-copy?05:26 **D**

05:26 No no this is the finished copy05:28

05:28 This is the finished copies... So you just glued it on top the...05:30 **D**

05:30 This whole magazine...05:32 **F**

05:33 Because this the way you produce this things 05:35 **D**

05:35 Xerox...05:35 **F**

05:36 You just glue things together and then copy them05:39 **D**

05:39 Yes... in one of these boxes I can show you the original. But yeah... This were printed. My dad used to run a company where they had a printing press. And for the money... Actually the first book that I made. Was when I was 18. It was this booklet. 06:12

06:13 So where does it come from your interest in the music in general I mean. 06:14 **D**

06:17 Well ah dkhsd is not my... Oh is not my copy... Is from somebody else. Uhm... The interest well... you know when I was even younger like 15 years old. So 1980-81 I got interested in punk music and it was all about oh you can do it yourself and stuff like that but then I realised if you want to be in a band you need to find people who you want to do music with. Some damn awkward place to rehearse ten stupid songs and so the whole punk think I only found interesting for maybe one year and then quickly I moved on to getting more interested in electronic music. Because of the electronic music I realised also that there was this other whole other world of mail art. And of cassettes releases, people doing cassettes. And uhm and if you do a casette you can make one copy. If you want to do an addition... a record you have to do 500 copies but a casette you can do only one copy.07:54

48:53 Alright so, lets talk about how the design evolved. The first one is a paper I just started typing and as you can see I was already into recycling cause I used old photocopies that I did not use. And I did the typewriter thing on my desk typewriter for 3 issues but my father was already... my father was a sort of amateur historian... amateur write of books about music, classical music. So pretty early on we had a computer with a matrix, .matrix printer and my father allowed me when he was working that I can use it. So i printed out this long stripes of text and i printed them out, cut them and stick them on the piece of paper. Which of course was a bit of gamble where to make this stripes but I was also in university at that time, studying history, and there was a small desktop computer room, and all the students had the possibilities to make their own magazines about their own field of interests. They had really this old very first apple macintosh computers. And it was a nightmare, a nightmare because of course my dad did not have an apple macintosh he had whatever a 186 dx or whatever it was called IBM clone thing. So I would type out the text at home and I was already working with somebody. So I would mail it to a big floppy disk to a friend of mine for a little bit correction of the text. The old very first macintosh they could handle the floppy disk but it was not always possible to convert straight one on one. So you open it up and then there is all this weird stuff in it. But the whole idea was it was a really sort off punkick do it yourself thing. So somebody said I will learn you how to do it. This program was called page maker. I will learn you how to do page maker but you have to do it yourself. Which of course sometimes it worked out well because if you have a template you can stick it in. 52:02

52:02 But you have kind of a template.52:02 **D**

52:02 Yeah... 52:06

52:07 In some places but it didn't always work because... 52:09

52:09 You have two columns and the I don't know... you have kind of a layout. 52:12 **D**

52:12 Yes. But as you can see in... It worked well for these issues but then I don't know what happened. Well, maybe I do know but turns out that is not possible to do proper translation. I would hurry. I think you would have to pay for the hour to use it or two hours or whatever so it was not entirely free. You will have to sign up for specific times to do it. I went back to you know what i will print out this little stripes of paper and I will do it in the old way. So that's all laser printing already but still cut on paste. In some issues and in some issues they were not cut and paste... Anyways total nightmare... And now we have to go to the mystery of why the rest is not here.

53:38 Is the same issues as in the archive. 53:40 **Y**

53:40 Yeah? And then what I did lets go back to that issue... So when I was done doing this 8 pages I would go to the coffee shop reduce this to a4 and then I had my master. Now what people did if they got it from me. So this is how would you say it - generation 0, then generation 1... the reduced version is number 2. Then I would use the tpex to make all the papers look really good if its fine and then I will make xerox out of it. So that's the second generation people got. So they would put on the yellow thing that was to indicate at home this is my original - I copy from that,. The yellow, you cant copy the yellow. The xerox don't see it. So it let's you know - this is my original. So that's why I think this is from V2. I am pretty sure V2 that is.55:01

55:01 So they markdown their mastercopies 55:01 **D 55:04 to know that is theirs55:04**

55:02 Yes.. Also if it gets lost... They had a small store that would be open on concerts and stuff... Ah that if one of the other issues was lost they could go back to the store and make one of the generation #3 the original. That's why the yellow is still there. And then of course I started to work for Stalplaat. Which was more or less sort of professional label company... without the xerox. But with the benefit of having a lot of professional designers working. And designers with access to /my archive i not really like a organised/ but this designers had laser printers. So the girlfriend of my boss she had a laser printer I would do this design and then leave her this space and she would copy that in. But still would be... this is two sheets... I glued them together to know what is back and front. And then of course... So these are the very old mine generations #1 of the first issues. You can see because they are all discoloured. And you can also see I used tpax here to smooth whatever. Stuff like this... Apparently here I was still doing the printout but without doing copy and paste. Also cause I worked with Stalplaat they hired me to do initially to buy and sell stuff for the store and mail order and distribution. They didn't mind that I am doing this stuff. Cause I worked sometimes in the evening etc. But on the other hand it must not take up too much time from other people. So i could not have said to my boss ey Can you ask his girlfriend. His girlfriend is right now actually a very famous dutch artist. Fiona Tan? Have you ever heard of her.57:57

57:57 A actually yeah I like the work a lot. 57:57 **Y**

58:01 She was the girlfriend in the early 90s of my boss in Stalplaat. And she would say why are you doing this stuff for this guy? She didn't like me obviously. So yes this are the first issues. As a first generation I guess. 58:28

58:29 That big one is generation 0, this is one. And apparently... the other thing with xerox machines technically they should always do the same thing. Make a proper xerox. But there are differences, sometimes the toner is not right and you can still see these sort of lines in between. But is not in any way of form organised.... Sometimes I would just go to a proper place and printed out for my own expense. You see i didn't mark these with yellow. Let me see. Oh yes there is also... So there have been 3 issues of vital in the USA. Ah the first one is the one with the 7inch with the sort of label design. The second one is part of another magazine called report. And the third one is a very small one. I think this is it. 1:00:15

1:00:15 Like a small format. 1:00:15

1:00:15 Yes this is for a tour that I did with my band and we played with a person from Kapottie Musik. But he also wrote for vital back then and we toured together in Europe so we made this small booklet to give away. Not sure what this was supposed to mean as if there is something missing. Oh no there is more pages.1:00:48

1:00:48 The layout is different.1:00:48

1:00:48 Yes that was done by guy who was living in new yourk and he was helping us out. This is a different format as you can see is a b-51:01:13

1:01:16 And why did u call it vital is there any reason for it1:01:17 **y**

1:01:16 Yes actually there is. Yes because the reason i stopped doing this null thing is I made this magazine and I printed a hundred copies, xerox them or print them. And I went to stalplaat because this is way before I worked in stalplaat. And I went to stalplalt, v2 couple of shops and I gave them couple of copies. They made a note oh we have 5 copies of your magazine and if they are sold we have to pay you. But if the next month you come back and ask if the magazines are sold the people told you ughh we don't know. Have a look yourself. I dont see any so they must be sold. Ugh we dont know. I say you owe me five gildas for a magazine and its like we don't have five gildas. And I thought this is insane. Why would you want to do a magazine. I wanna do a magazine to promote stuff but I dont want to loose money on it and then I thought i should have a format that is really cheaply made does not involve any car. You can send out a single envelope for the lowest amount of postage and how many pages is that - apparently two a4 pages folded. You pack it up with information. And it is a more dynamic way of publishing this why the word VITAL. Had I known if in 2020 I would receive tons and tons of spam with the word Vital in them I think I would not have chosen VITAL. But yes that is the reason I thought yea you know I can use this. That was a mistake.1:03:23

1:03:23 Yes it changes meaning with the time but i think the name is good. Is also about this love for music. 1:03:30 y

1:03:30 Well that is of course something that i still have because now I a doing this vital weekly thing. And that is really an expansion of the whole magazine. Cause at one point two things happened. Ah you know my boss did not like that i was spending time and resources on making this. Although it was not too much. I had to ask a designer, I had to ask for printout, I had to print the copies out. And then somebody comes into the store and he says ughh I see I have copies 1 2 3 4 5 6 but not 7 can u make me one. Ah I don't know what to do. And then i felt why am i doing this. And one day in stalplaat an email arrives. The first time I heard the word email was in 1993. We are touring in america and we are staying with peole in their homes. Eventually we arrived in pitsburg with some guy and he says I have to go to check my e-mail. And I thought what the fuck are you talking about. But 2 years later my boss and guy who produced stuff. said they will install this tel net thing. 5 mins later they were sating we are in we are in. I was wondering what the fuck is this. We are supposed to be selling CDs, what are you doing here. And then we had email. And the first emails were newsletters attached with all these adresses. And then with copy paste I could send my own newsletter. Copy paste and spam everybody else. It was a time when you did not know what is a spam. Of course quickly on I understood that people don't like it. Yes fuck off with your bullshit. I dont want your shitty reviews and then later on of course it was all more formalized. You had to sign up with an IP adress, you had to confirm adress. If you say add me to your mailing list i can't do it for you you have to do it yourself. 1:06:26

1:06:27 And do you have any idea? Do you see everyone that subscribed to the online magazine? 1:06:30

1:06:29 Yes. I can also unsubscribe people if you want to. I can go to the system and put you email in the unsubscribed section. If people are very shitty I do that. 1:06:51

1:06:51 Is there a lot of shitty people/1:06:54

1:06:54 There are lots of shitty people1:06:54

1:06:53 Like they want you to review your music or?1:07:01

1:07:01 Lots of reasons that is also when people don't like what you do. I don't know that many people... I don't know that many... I know many people inside this music. I dont know many people outside this music. But I do know one and he is Steven Willson and he is a wild known rock artist. This year he is going to play in Amsterdam once in Aphas, he fills up is sold out already. He is that big but he is also really into that kind of music. But he said I know a lot of people in a lot different music genres rock, hard rock etc. but also experimental musicians. The worst people who are the most easily offended people are the experimental music people. Say something like your latest record is meh and they wont speak to you for two years. And he is right that happens. Oh yes you wrote a review about my EP but you dont understand what i am doing.1:08:26

1:08:26 I also remember that i was reading something on the website that you say that is not your fault if you don't write a good review and the artist does not like it.1:08:32

1:08:34 Yes but you know if you can't take the criticism you should not be doing music. You should be doing music but you should not be releasing records. Also not to mail the to people.1:08:48

1:08:48 So how did it work in the beginning when you started VITAL you were already receiving music from people or? 1:08:55

1:08:55 Oh yes yes I was.. That is interesting cause one thing that is a, also should be mentioned is that i did this blue booklet. A cassette catalogue. I was 16 when I became interested in this whole cassette thing and started collecting information. So that is a paper form of discogs. The stupid thing of course is that it does not say anything. Some tape names adress some more names. Bahama tapes no information. It should have said Bed alaskam - it is only pop music or noise or whatever. That it should say. I was doing I did this magazine or a booklet or whatever is called in 1000 copies. It costed 1000 gildas. My dad loaned them to me and he never got them back. Uhm a copy of this landed in germany a guy called krauhvaen. And he said oh wow you seem to know a lot about all of these people. I want to do a casette compilation with dutch noise music. can you organise this for me. And then I said oh yes sure. So i wrote to all these people that i like saying give me a track. And this was in a time when I was already in a contact with all this people. I already corresponded with them. I would say oh well you know this is for a compilation of a german guy blabla. Soon i had a 60minute tape compilation. And then I thought you know I can also start my own cassette label. So that happened in 1984 at the same time I started doing my own music. So all of this is connected. I did the casete catalogue for a few more years. Keep of collecting information I did the null null, the vital and at the same time I did my own casette label. So all this people will send me casettes for trades and i would write about them. Send them back a vital issue. And they would say oh interesting next time i get it you get a record for free. So uhm thats how i got eventually all of this promos that people would send out to me. I like what you do ah have a record. 1:12:13

1:12:13 So you still do it like that? In the site I think I read that you only review physical copies.1:12:18

1:12:19 Yes because I sell this. That is what I live from. My side interest is not selling on stuff is more like a thing of survival. So yes what you see here is stuff from this month and then every issue two tree issues respond oh I want that and that can u reserve this for me. sometimes more than one person kind of like the same thing1:12:55

1:12:54 So you kind of distribute the music.1:12:56

1:12:57 Well i sell it. In the end of the month I make a list. I have a separate list for people that want to buy stuff.1:13:06

1:13:06 And people can contact you through discogs or thorugh the magazine?1:13:06

1:13:05 Sometimes. Also now I am more and more selling for people on discogs.1:13:26

1:13:27 So your collection is always like shifting kind of. You don't keep the stuff 1:13:34

1:13:34 sometimes if i really like something I would keep it. Sometimes the real physical object. There are maybe 4-5 artists that i really like to keep the stuff off. And sometimes I make mp3 and keep the mp3. 1:13:49

1:13:50 And back then when you started do you think that the people had an access to the music somehow?1:13:56

1:13:58 It was like really small releases/1:14:03

------

1:14:03 The idea of doing ,magazines in general was to do what the internet does now to make sure there is contact. You do music, and I do magazine, and you want to get some publicity is not just for selling but also to that you know there is something out there and you want to contact these people. After a while a magazine has certain certain net – a group of followers.

1:14:41 you know what it is about, something you can trust. That's interesting, you have to trust a magazine to write about you. So if you read my magazine and you think uhm out of 5 times 4 times he was right it was an interesting contact to make. You'll also do it for a sixth time. If you think about a magazine that its bullshit. If you think 2–3 times its not the right people, what am i doing here, than its not your magazine.

1:15:18 the whole idea of this magazine is to establish the link between musicians and also the consumers in sense that most people who want stuff are also doing stuff. They do magazine, mail art, or music themselves or have a label. Quite a few people who want to have a label put out music themselves. Especially people who like design, yeah oddly enough. I think theres 2 types of people who want a label – fanatics who like the music and designers. Beacause even if you cant do music but you like music, i mean everybody can do music or design but not everybody is good at it, but yeah..

1:16:36 Uk label touch, quite well known label, started in the 80s doing cassetes and lots of cds these days. Its basically run by a very clever guy whos now doing music himself, but John Mosercroft who worked with Nevill Brody for a long time. So the slogan was quality meets design. So this is a thing and if you know how to press a record or make a casette or whatever and you have good visual imagination you can make a beautiful cover.

1:17:29 Yeah definetely theres some really beautiful covers. Yeah absoulutely. On the other hand you see from labels that are run by people who really like music they usually dont have that nice covers. which is also.. who cares?

1:17:45 the thing with staalplaats was that staalplaats was also very visul based label they did lots of strange packaging. But i also always say honestly I dont care that much. I like the music way more than a strange package.

1:18:16 so now Im preparing a book which Im gonna publish myself. I dont know if you noticed but I did write a book about staalplaats and it was published few yours ago in france.

Yeah I've seen it on google.

1:18:54 There is also some book in russian with your face about classical music I think.

Oh yeah its a magazine. This one. You can read this? Yeah because Im bulgarian. oh okay. One day if you have a lot of time in your hands you can translate. hahah

Its a pretty long article based on sort of workshop/lecture thing i did in moscow. Broken music yeah. Kapotte muziek is my band. Nice.

1:20:01 this book was published in france and it sold out already 3 years ago.

Is taht old picture of you? Yeah haha i was 18. Sweet. And it was in bedroom in my parents house and im holding a bunch of casettes. This was from an article that got a lot of publicity from leftwing media because you know young people doing your own stuff, do it yourself culture..

1:20:41 How was the situation back then in this area like politically? What was the context.. How was it a the times, you know.. Im wondering if this do it yourself attitude was also a response to something. Because you are also saying in some issues that you need to like.. spread the virus about the magazine?

Oh yeah that was just an expression not like to day haha (covid-19). No the idea was that it should be.. everybody should do their own stuff and of course in 80s, atleast in Netherlands alot of unemployment for young people and the idea was if you are doing your own music, your own cassetes and magazines you can escape all of that.

It wasnt necesarily political, but it was a punk spirit but for a different kind of music.

1:21:57 So last year I did a reissue softcover, i did some more copies they are coming on friday. But this book was also properly published somewhere,? Yes. But yeah since i published this i thought yea you know this very easy i know how to do this now.

1:22:35 Im gonna open this up so you can see the difference. this is way thinner paper.

(opening the book etc..)

1:24:30 but when i see the cost of production of doing this i though i can do the vital book myself. So you want to include the issues 1 to 44? 44 yeah, they are all scanned. And i made an index for so you can easily find the right page or article. Why i think is really helpful.

1:25:24 Do you include links in the digital version to the music bandcamps and stuff?

Yea i Do. If you go to the online version there are also links now.

1:25:46 I had an interesting discussion yesterday with a guy who is actually designing my vital book, about how it looks. Couple of years ago somebody said, your lines are too long you dont use any sort of breaks in the lines. So since then i have been doing this but now it looks like this (shows on computer). Its horrible! It reads better though i think. But if you go to telephone version something else happens.

1:27:29 Well as you can see im not a designer, i break these lines by hand.

1:28:30 i still use thi really free thing composer to this website..

Ye but i think its nice to do this like that diy. Yeah thats what my friend said it looks basic but you know nobody else has this so maybe thats the idea. why would i bother with it?

We like your website. Also our teacher said that its pretty nice that its only text.

Oh okay.

1:29:13 Lot of people say that i should move towards something like wordpress and i could include images and hyperlinks.

To be honest i kind of like this. Its not super practical but it has certain character. Same feeling like the magazine.

1:30:23 also nobody pays for this. I have 4500 subscribers but in donations this yer i got 100 euros hahah. So I have been giving out for 25 years for free so its a bit wierd to start charging money for it. if all subscribers give me 1 euro. I would not have to sell the stuff, the records. I would just give it away. 1 euro a month? i would have an income..

1:31:17 but i read somewhere that the printed ones you very sending for like 5 euros? I'm not sure. It should written be on there. A some point people started asking can i subscribe? 5 guilders old dutch currency hehe. Old money. 6 issues a year 12 guilders.

1:32:07 i had 6 issues a year. After number 21 is a bigger issue. But we thought no this doesnt work lets go back to 2 sheets and a supplement. The supplement was more like theoretical stuff, book reviews discussion, more of insight into the whole musical debate. So people could say oh i want to subscribe only to these 2 sheets or the supplements.

1:33:14 yeah so im not sure how i organised these subscriptions if i had a list..

There must have been a lot of work involved in the distribution right? Putting into envelopes going to post and stuff?

Yeah but i already worked at staalplaats and we had post everyday. we went to post office everyday to mail stuff. And later on we hired the post to come to us so it was even easier.

Like i said my boss and other people they didnt always like that I devoted time to it and their resources in printing. Theres one interview that came via email, but we had 1 email adress. Your email is now always somewhere in the cloud, back then If you checked email on one computer then next days the email is not on the other computer, because i already retrieved it here. So somebody retrieved the interview that i needed and it was gone from everywhere and i kept emailing this guy hey idiot wheres the interview? Then i realised it was on somebodys home computer from staalplaats.

1:35:19 I did find it eventually. That didnt add up to the fact that staalplaats didnt like me doing it. The reviews i could do that at home, take the floppy disk back to work and mail it out. there was not so much work involved anymore, however what i did is for the first 100 issues i made these booklets. They were properly corrected in english but at the same time i did my book. And that was for staalplaats more interesting cos this was more of a commercial thing. I went to the copyshop and had 100 copies made and we would sell them for a proper price. There was some money coming back to staalplaats. I didnt make any money out of it.

but you did all the reviews so it was your intellectual property.

yea i would be delighted if somebody would say you know im gonna correct all these text from all the issues and eventually have a massive amount of reviews.

Who did this artwork? I did it. Nice! This is actually something i still do xeroxes. I distort stuff in xerox or scanners. In staalplaats we had a very slow photocopier. If you would be in staalplaats today i would be going to my copier and keep on talking. And the suddenly pick up something put on the mashine and keep on talking.

1:38:44 Many of this is just envelopes. I even dated them. I still use them for my music projects.

1:39:35 These are some of my original covers from casette label. Again same typewriter.

1:40:09 Like i said my archiving is not really good.

1:40:49 how do you feel about making vital digital these days? Its nice to have something physical in your hands right? its much more easier now in terms of printing and distribution..

Uhm well, you know this sort of thing vital weekly its okay if its online because more people can see it. For my own music I dont know... i still like to do casettes. I like casettes still after all these years. Sometimes I make music that has more rhythm so i think this should be on vinyl or i do something thats very quiet that should be on cd. Its usually very quick i put it on bandcamp for free.. who cares

1:42:06 So you also connect different media to different kind of genres?

Oh yeah yeah, definitely.

1:42:20 You think it makes it more serious if you put it on vinyl compared to cassete.

No thats not it, for me the difference is technical. If you do techno music you can put it on cd without any problem, but on vinyl it will sound better. Good quiet ambient music sounds way better on properly mastered cd. On vinyl you immediately have this hiss and static. fuzzy noisy lo-fi ambient music you can put on cassette. And anything else you can always put it online. So thats the difference for me.

1:43:21 for me also if i make music that takes me really long time to make, I do sometimes that kind of music i dont want to give it away for free because i spent so much time on it. If you have quick idea and i go my back room sit down and record it and it takes me 20 minutes and i think nice its i might aswell give it out for free.

1:43:48 how do you record these days? do you record digitally or do you use like tape deck or something? like a reel to reel or something.

Noo haha. I wish i had a reel to reel. Actually i mainly record on my laptop. but since a month or two my 4track recorder is repaired so i can use that. But i forgot how it worked.

I had to download a manual to remind me how it works because i hadnt used it for so long.

So its like a tascam?

Its a fostex 4 track yeah.

1:44:33 But these machines are good people still use them

Yeah, im gonna do a music trade project with a guy who repaired it, he also has the same machine. we exchanged cassetes where two channels are his and two channels are mine.

And if they are full then we both do a mix of the material.

1:45:00 But the mix itself we recorded on harddisk or a computer like the recorded that you have you use for live recordings or outside for field recordings. Also in that respect I don't have anything against digital or analog recordings. For me its not really an issue. I rather think of what I want to do and what to use and how to use it than oh i must have a modular synth or I must have a laptop or I must have this and this and that. With the exclusion of anything else but its also because i do lot of different kinds of music. I do more techno-ish music and also very ambient music. The techno music i do on my ipad for example.

1:46:22

There's a video on youtube where you have a really strange setup of random objects that you use for making sounds.

Yeah that's kapotte music project probably. It's a trio. I'm not sure that we even exist anymore, we only play live. We dont do studio recordings. And we use junk that we found on the streets to play with. When we arrive in the afternoon we go to the street and we just pick up anything that makes a sound. And if its something small that we like to take home and to use later on. Like this thing full of dust. and i would use this in concerts.

1:47:26

I didn't keep that many things over the years. Some broken toys. Just to investigate the sound that it makes. Not like what people do when they start hitting on things. Why would you want to hit on junk. Use the junk it has dirt on it and you can rub it together and you amplify the surface thats totally different sound.

1:48:26

But like I said last concert was 3 years ago with Kapotte muziek and nobody asks.. I'm not that kind of person to go out and ask for concerts anymore. If people find me they know where I am and can contact me and I'll come but I'm not gonna write to everybody ugh can I play can I play, you know. For years I tried to play at rewire in Den Haag. They don't want me, they don't even respond. I have no idea. I don't know what they want. They want young transgenders I guess and not old grumpy white man. Haha.

1:49:25

Honestly this is probably true. I'm gonna be 55 this year and 15 years, right when i left staalplaat in 2003 if you would ask me what will you be doing after you are 50. I would have said yeah you know I hope to get rid of the vital weekly stuff and that I'll be rcognized for the music I'm doing and have some interesting projects going in whatever field. So now I'm 55 and i'm apparently still doing vital weekly and nothing much else. So some people would say Oh Frans he is the pioneer in electronic music, which is definetely not true. I'm not a pioneer. It's also not recognized by a lot of people – Oh yeah that's the guys from Nijmegen he does music but don't book him not many people will show up. Yeah that's true haha.

1:50:48

Last couple of years i palyed with a guy from Norway and we did small tours for a week or so. In germany and Liuthania and Helsinky and so on. And we only played in places that were not bigger than this room.

1:51:07

But this is cozy. Yeah but when 5 people show up you can't even pay for the train to next city. Unless of course you treat is as a holiday. And i realized that that's not what i want. Also because i want to focus on trying to learn new stuff in technology that i find interesting. Which is not modular synths. How to use for instance 4 ipads in a concert and have them control sound together so you have one control surface and make interesting music with just that. That's what i want to try and find out.

1:52:22

So what are you going to do with this stuff?

We have to figure it out, we still have to put together a concept but it's generally a bit comlicated this assigment. This idea of transcoding. What does transcoding mean? It's like putting it into different mediums. You have certain content and then you transform it into different mediums. Lets say you have all these printed things and you design an app that allows you to browse through all the different content or something. To put it in a very simple way i guess.

Allright but its not like something to use on website?

Yea sure it could be website also.

1:54:03

We are thinking of something that would combine all these different elements, aspects of the thing like the reviews, the music itself, the text, graphics and images and then make a tool that would allow you to browse it more intuitively. That's what we have to figure out.

1:54:26

So lets suppose i wasn't doing a book with the vital stuff. How would you do it?

All the 44 issues. I mean book is nice because you have them all together in one collection. That's nice but the main topic is music so it would great to have access to it at the same time you know.

1:55:04

Lets say you have this issu, its 10 i think, so you would read this review you could click it and it would bring you to the music. Yeah for example, and then you would have the graphics connected to it like the album covers that you could browse through. Could be nice.

So thats a lot of work. I suppose you would have to do it manually.

We also have a class where we are supposed to design a tool that would maybe collect these things for us. It's all connected to tho topic of archiving.

1:56:34

The distribution itself is also interesting and the mail art also, it's not so common anymore.

1:57:08

I have a box of my mail art, It's a small box beacause I quickly realised that mail art is not my thing. People would send out a blank page and you would have to fill it up and the you get it back in the end. I made this mail art magazine myself.

1:59:53

It was also quite expensive, lot of these projects required you to make a lot of copies..

2:01:24

I like the idea of downloading something randomly and then getting something else. We can send you the link to that..

2:02:25

Ye also somebody put a usb stick somewhere in wall so you can go there with your computer and get the files.

2:02:42

Would you like to have all the 44 scans?

Amazing, thanks..

2:03:12

When do you think you'll be finished with the book?

That depends on the designer really.

2:04:55

I want to also print another book at the same time because over the years i wrote a bunch of stuff for people like notes on records, aplications for grants for musicians, tour diaries and stuff like that. So there's gonna be a collection, a small page-bundle but there's gonna be no interest in that I think. So I'm thinking if i do the Vital book so people would say oh you know you have a second book for sale it's only like 5 euros I'll take that.

2:06:45

You also reviewed some people from Bulgaria.

Yeap "?Imactives?". Yea theres small comunity. You know these people? Yeah i know some of the people that release for them.

Actually I wrote to him cos I never played in Bulgaria. I'm not somebody that wants to play in Berlin every 2 months.

The scene in Bulgaria is quite nice.

I've never been to Bulgaria at all.. I've been to Greece and Slovenia to play concerts.

2:08:13

I have played in most of European countries.

Did you ever play in Czech republic? Yes along time ago in Prague in Archa theatre in year 1995. Really? I used to work there. But i was born in 1994 so...

2:08:46 it was really wierd. We had 4 concerts in Italy and 1 in Prague. And we had to drive from Sicily to Prague and we thought we would drive to Udin and next day from Udin to Prague. Unfortunately we got stuck in Bologna in snow for 8 hours. We arrived in Prague 9.30 in the evening. We tried to phone them, but we couldn't reach anybody.

We arrived and the dutch ambassador came because he paid for the concert. But we were like zombies. But we did the concert and next day we left and that was the last time I was in Prague. And one time before in 1970 when i was 4 years old and my father used to live in Prague.

2:10:27

Do you know something about czech classical music? Antonín Dvořák? Yes of course he's the man. My father used to live with his daughter in law, not as a couple. But when my father was 20 he had this idea to write a book about Dvořák. And he wrote her a letter – oh can i stay with you? My father had a bit of autism I think.. SO he wrote her can I stay with you cos I want to study Antonín Dvořák. And she said Oh come over. Hahah.

So he stayed there for 6 months. But then my granddad wrote to him, son you are in communist country I want you to come home and get a job. Of course he didn't say Fuck off old man, he said Yeah I'm coming home.

2:11:15

If you turn your head behind you the grey bundles are the original scripts of the book from 60s. It's not complete. There are even original pictures, he got them for free.

2:12:28

Did you ever review any czech music in Vital?

Yea, oddly enough a guy called Tomáš Dvořák. But I think Dvořák is a common name right? Yea it is.

This is the real book it came out in 1990. My father went out to buy books about Mozart, Beethoven and whatever every week. I wrote the first chapter about czech history, I made a research.

2:14:34 Oh I have to go soon. What are you doing are you going to this place tonight? The riso cafe?

Yea I think we have to go home, we live quite far away in Den Haag,

I used to live there.

Do you know Bunker records? I used to live right around the corner from Guy Tavares. Oh nice is he still around? Yea I saw him talk somewhere not so long ago..

2:16:10

When I was married my wife when she was still studying in Arnheim the councelman from Den Haag came to the school and said ladies if you want a job in Den Haag sign here. My girlfriend signed. She graduated on Monday and on Tuesday morning she had a job.

I was working at staalplaat at the time in Amsterdam so we had to move to Den Haag, which was.. I didn't like that.

2:17:02 We left 4 years later cos we were really fed up with Den Haag. There was a lot of noise in the night in our area. People shouting. But now the city is super quiet. But Yeah Guy from Bunker records lived around the corner.. There was also an interesting scene in the Hague I think, all the squats..

2:17:41

If I had nothing to do there's a bunch of things that are worth documenting. The whole bunker scene is one of them. It's really intense period. There's not much information online but some of the guys are still around like Guy, IF, Rude 66 and so on.

2:18:23

It was good music but they had all such intense lives, it was so filled with depression and drugs and suicide and parties that lasted way too long. I was never part of it, I never saw any of it. I met some of those guys and they talked about it and I always thought this something, somebody should make a documentary about this.

2:18:59

i know that they still release music. Also clone records are making reprints. So it still exists but I don't know what they are doing. At staalplaat we used to help Guy out doing the cd versions of the records. He is partly from Brazil and Indonesia I think at one point he came in and had a cd and wanted to do a little bootleg with indonesian rock bands. I was like Guy 500 copies why? And he said I'll sell them in a weekend.. Indo-rock its called. He knows about this sort of stuff also..

2:20:13

Well Den Haag.. It has also been a while since I played in Den Haag. I don't miss though I have to say...

# Transcoding

We decided to concentrate on the **first 10 issues** which are published in the time span of almost **3 years – 1987–1989**. We want to create a digital alternative containing the magazine itself + all other contents that were difficult to access at the time for the readers – mainly the reviewed music.



- We want to create an environment which allows you to browse the content and understand its origins.

- The digital tool we would like to create allows us to transcode the 3 main contents of the magazine into a new type of master copy – one that you can browse online. And experience the music itself.

- By making this environment we want to connect the viewer/listener more closely to the person who is committing his life to creating this magazine. We want to expose the nature of the magazine which is consequently the nature of Frans De Waard.

  

This environment will be accesible via website that will consist of three main parts (2 tools and the interview)



### TOOL One

#### Description

Printing tool for the viewers of the website to be able to reproduce the physical magazine at home, and spread it further to other potential viewers. Here is [link](https://www.notion.so/VITAL-ISSUES-b97881dc1241496485d10541d3aacde2) to pictures of physical magazine, which will be used for the printing tool. Some of the scans you can see below.

#### Methods

First we took images of the artefact simply with a Smartphone. Later we used the scanning machines in the IISG archive to get better scans. And later we got cleaned up scans from Frans de Waard himself. We used the text recognition within Adobe Acrobat to extract raw text from the scans. Then we pasted this text into Notion software. We created a printing tool in Atom coding software by using html, python, javascript, css and less languages.

**VITAL 1**

NO COPYRIGHT PUBLICATION REPRINT NOW! VITAL 1 Published by: Frans de Wsard - Opaalstraat 19 - 6534 XK Nijmegen - Holland As editorials are mostly boring, we will do an editorial for only once. In this we will explain what VITAL is about. This is a thin .information pamphlet or newsletter or whatever. We hope tp . publish it every three months. In every issue we will have one interview, several reviews of records and tapes and news. So far, nothing new. The new thing comes in when ~e start speaking about the edition, for there is none. We will make of each issue a certain amount of copies which we will spread around to distributors. But each distributor will get only 1 copy, a so-called 'mastercopy'. If they want to sell it, they will have to make xeroxed copies themselves. Every copy is a mastercopy: We have left enough margin at the top and at the bottom for our american friends, so that they are able to xerox it on their business sized paper. Well, stepping forward as always, we hope to serve you with vital information. The stru ggle continues. COUP OE GRACE Coup Oe Grace is an organisation with some reputation. Their creative output so far included: music, booklets, many appearancss in magazines and a mail order distribution. But music is the thing that most of you will have heard of Coup De Grace. An inter view with one of the memberswas composed through mail late 1986, with updates from more recent letters. What did you do before C.D.G. 7 I used to build electronic devices, I had a group which made music with these devices - at that time I really had no idea that people compos ed electronic music at all. It was extremely simple: metronome beat rhythms, oscilla t ors, dis t orted amplified guit ars, r el i gi oos s peec hes and distorted vocals. I was very yoong, but I designed & built al l th e ins t rument s myself . I recorde d ene c30 cas s et t e mhi ch was titled 'The coven of St even Marc at o •. That was also the name of th e group . I t comes from the f i lm ' Rosemery!s Baby', which was one of my favourite . movies es a child (and stil l is). Before of fi ci all y startin g COG I spent a lot of ti me f or mulating the ideas f or i t in my mind. Some things I later used as COG material were actually done essli er, li ke th e flyer 'The Sickn ess ' (in 1st Annual Report) - th at was pre-COG. Coup De Grace started officially on 1.17.1984. - What's more important for COG, music or visual things? Why 7 The init i al idea behin6 COG was to not have it be limited to any one medium ••• it was to be certain philosophies or ideas C. Cl. G. COUP CE GRACE translated into many different forms. Music was one of them. But now after doing music for 3 years ws hava gotten discouraged. Whs we started out not so many people were doin it & it was more interesting. Now there ass to be way too many groups doing things without svsn thinking about what they are eras t ing. Actually 1crssting 1 is a bad word sin cs a lot of the ideas are blatantly stolen. We feel almost ell of the mssic coming out nowadays is garbage, and we aren't interested in making music in that kind of situati on. So, for ths time being at least, we've ceased recording. Maybe in the future sometime we'll resume it. Also after thinking about it we cams to the conclusion that people are much more affected by what they see & rssd, than by what they hear. So we're concentrating on visual material now. Soon we will begin publishing books, wn the proper sense. Wa hope to spend more time om films & fil mmaking, which is something I personally have been involved with from a young age. - Are there many people in the USA interested in underground activities like COG? What's it like living in the USA compared t o Europe (COG was on tour here in september 1986)? There are people in the USA interested, and for example Paul (Paul Anthony, COG mail order service secretary - ad) has told me that around 90% of the msilorder customers are American. Living here in the United Stat es is not something I am particularly fond of. It's s very money ori ented place. COG is not interested in money, except when it is paying for our projects. All the money we make from the mailordsr-servics goes back into COG. As doss money that members make at outside jobs. Europe to ms is not so money-oriented, at least the atmosphere sssme not so hectic. - The work of COG seems to haves good documentation, why is it important to know what's around of COG? I think documentation is valuable as otherwise many things, for all practical purposes, would not exist. Everything is a document in one way or another. All books are just documents of s writer's thoughts/ideas/ emotions st a given pmint in time. In terms of COG documentation ·(Like Annual Reports booklets etc.) - I think these are j ust an information source for those who cars to investigate. I don't want it to be too easy for people to find out or squire materials we've releases, but it is only fair to let people know what is available or has been published. Then if they want to, THEY can make effort to look for it. With a bit of persistence and luck, they'll find what they want ••• - Isn't~ contradiction that the work of COG has always a small edition, but with a message, so you will reach only a small audience? I don't think it's s contradiction. I don't think that if everyone were forced to see our material, or if it were easily available to them, that more than 1% would understand where we are coming from anyway. But the small editions also have something to so with our finances & distribution. So in the future we will hopefully be doing larger & lar ger editions, but keeping our original standards. We will always be much more interested in quality over quantity. - Public School is s subject that comes around in the work of COG quite often, could you explain this? Public school (and private school - in fact eduction in general) is something which was integral to our initial work. I t was the main impetus behind many of our first recordings, which appear on Commencement (The first Coup De Grace tape, now sold out - ed). I had been attending school up until t he exact day that Commencement was released. On that day I left school and haven't been back since. Everyt hing I have seen and witnessed so f ar in my life which calls itself 'education' has always upon close scrutiny revealed itself (at least to me) to be whomly against forging people of intelligence. It actually fosters a hatred of learning. Most everything I have learned of value I taught myself, on my own time. So st one time involuntary 'eduction• was s part of my day to day existence. This is no longer true. Therefor I doubt it will plays part in our future projects. Actually no recordings since 1984 have been at al l s pecific~lly concerned with the subject of education. It does still interest us though. - How important i s mt to be extreme as possible or sreth ere also other things import ant? I do not think there is any such thing as being extreme. It is a wholly subjective matter. So it is impossible for me to answer this question. I could not honestly say that I feel any COG release has ever been 'extr eme•. The thought has never crossed my mind. We'll let the people who see it & hear it, call it what they will. It real l y does not matter to us. We ourselves have no pretentions of being 'extreme' or anybbing else. We do what we do & we stand by it. I can say that for the future our activities will only get stronger & more powerful. Something to be reckooed with ••• Some information must be given on Coup De Grace as an update to this interview. Micheal of Coup De Grace has come to Europe to live here for s while. Coup De Grace is planning a memorial album with tracks from their long deleted first tape+ live and · unreleased material. Also three books will appear. Also some plans exist for releases on vi .dee.

O.K. this is a good 7" single, that's not the reason why I wanted to r eview it. This review is ment as s complaint: this single is packed in a shabby black pa per. It has a small black and white bidding with the r emark Nurse With Wound - Crank .and The Ter mite Queen - Wisecrack and WW0 1 (What does WWm ean?). The labels of the single are totally black, of course with no infor mation. As a real collector I looked at the scratchings in the centre, but again no information. This should cost you [2.so](http://2.so/) pounds. But i t 's the music tha t counts of course. And the music is good, altough it sounds like two times Nurse With Wound. This 7" is also available fro m United Dairies which have currently made all the old deleted records available on tape again. Most of them in their original form, some albums are remixed, like 150 Murderous Passions and NWW's Insect and Indiaidual Silenced. Check this out. Bytheway: Anyone otherthere who ha§ a Nurse With Wound discography (inc. compilations) for us, we're planning to do such a thing for an upcoming VITAL issue. contact: United Dairies. 40 st.Johns Villas - Islington - London Nl9 3EG - Ul<-- OE FABRIEK/RTC- IS IT SAFE? (7" on De fabriek Records & Tapes fabprod 6). Two groups from Holland on a 7" against nuclear- energy. De fabriek is fro m these t wo the most well-ll:nown. Their track on this single sounds like their recent album 'Mads In Spain', that is industrial, with a heavy rhythm and sounds coming in and going out. Their side is on 33 RPM, whilst the other is on 45 RPM. ATC'@ mesic is hard to describe. It is very rhythmic with all kinds of percussion and mumbl ing voices. Their experi mental influence is not industrial but more ethnic. This single was pac ked in a dark-pink wall paper cover wit h blue prints. A limited edition of about 279 copies. So hurry. When you ask abou t th i s, don't for get to obtain t heir catal ogue of tapes, records and video's. Contact: De fabriek - POBOX 1135 - 8001 BC Zwolle - Hol l and Pl6 04 - Tionchor (Album on Selektion Records slp 013). Again, this is one of my favourite bands. On this new album you will 15 tracks that have been previosly evailaT ble on compilation tapes and records. How these were selected is not clear to me, but it doesn't matter. Even if you are a collector who has all Pl6 04 material you must have this record, because in some cases they remixed the tracks. for those unfamiliar with their sound, I must say that it is a fine combination of free-jazz (mainly the old stuff) and musique concrete (the new things). b!hat I like part~culary about this album is that all tracks are well documentated (recording dates, instruments etc.). On the backside you will find their extensive discography. But there is one item missing there and I like to mention it here in the way they do it: ) QUEST-CE QU'IL YA 7 International Compilation Cassette, c90 Requiem req 005 (Norway) Incl. also Cultural Amnesia, Attrition etc. l Pl6.D4 track: Paris, Morgue Rec?

LA SONORITEJ AUNE& THE HATERS- THE INTERSTELLERD ESTROYEMD USIC MAIL PROJECT( c60 on SJ Organisation 012). L.S.J. is a -duo from francs which did a project with our conceptual friend from Canada. L.S.J.send him a tape with their favourite sounds, like radio voices, birds, gloomy sounds, for The Haters to sample. After sampling The Haters added a few of his destroyed music loops to it (car-crashes, falling glass etc). I like the result, but I must admit that it sounds more like The Haters than like la Sonorite Jeune (I heard their first tape, Heliae). So I am pretty curious about the second tape from la Sonorite Jaune, which should be released in september. Address: see above. DIE RACHE (c60 on Prion Tapes) and TESENOA• LO (c60 on Prion Tapes pr 3). These two tapes are made., by members from PCR, a band from West Germany. Die Rache consists of rhythmbox with s~nthesizer, sometimes with an in-mix of radio noises. It is a nice hometape product, altough not surprising. Tesendalo is baeicly made with radionoise, with many added noise to it. Thie is a really disturbing release and if you are not •trained' to listen to such noise, you will be quite shocked.

The piece they played there was in fact more like New Carrollton, but that I discovered later. I got some of their tapes, and I must say: they are all great I review one of them, but actually I had to review all of them. One of hand their music consists of sampled noise (very short pieces of orcheetra 1 e, machine noises etc.) and on the other hand their music is a bit like the music from New Carrollton.

A docuprovised music with the use of tapes to mentation album is planned for release in their recent work in the field of collage the near futore. and musique concrete. In the early 180 1s At their V2 performance on september the there was first a german band PO (of which 12th I handed out a few. questions which is told that they sound like Throbbing they answered by mail. Gristle) who released an album, a single, and a flexidisc. All these releases were on their own label called Wahrnehmungen. As the line-up changes, also the name is changed into Pl604 (ectober 1980). Some time later (early '82) the Wahrnehmungen label changed also n~mes: Selektion is the new name. Some tapes are deleted, and the label starts to produce records (today all old tapes are deleted (which is a pity - ed.) and they produce records only), like the compilation album Masse Mensch, Pl604 1s Kuhe In 1/2 Trauer and Oistruot and albums from SBOTHI and Mixed Sand Philanthropist. On Pl604's album Oistruct they use tapes which are send in from allover the world in oru§r ta fflijM§ij Collaboration between all kind of groups around. The concept was simple: they wanted groups play together without seeing eachother. This concept is also used on the double album Nichts Niemand Nirgends Nie !, but instead of 15 groups only two bands are working on each other's - Pl604 is one of the bands from the early 'BO's that are now well-known (like nee - STEREO ..-.. - .--.....- .-.-.. ,._ -~-~- -----~.

How can you describe your own music compared with other bends? Does a band become more acceptable when they make music for soma years? wa think that there era a lot or ractors which influence the development or groups/ persons. Ona of the most important ractors might be the financial question. Buying equipment/instruments, producing/releasing records cost a lot of money. If you don't care for financial success, you may perhaps be able to finance these things by making music, but you'll never be able to earn much more - so that it is enough to spend living etc •• It is possible to do irregular jobs for some time/years, but that's not (for most people) not a perspective for the whole life. Pl604 members do regular jobs, so it's not necessary to earn oney with music. On the other hand this eans that t here isn't much tie left. Another factor is the aesthetic position. There are lots of people who do/ did noise music as this was a kind of fashion for some time and then follow other fashions when they change. - There seems also to be a development in your presentation on stage. What do you used to do and what are you now doing? Explain also the relation between the music and the used visual elements, PO/Pl604 started in 1980 with experiments in combinating conventional rock-instrumentation, prepared tapes and visual elements (slides, films etc.), Whilst in the beginning the •conventional elements• were dominating, the experimental elements became ore and more ii:iportant later. As there are very few concerts every concert is different from the ones before (and after), When visual ele ments are used we try to have a close relationship between the and the music. 1980/1981 many concrete elements were used (for instance pictures of trains/railway stations combined with train/railway noises and lyrics dealing with the theme 'Hauptbahnhof'), Today the connection is mostly abstract: similar principles of structuring films and music (especially for the Captured usic festival in Karlsruhe in february 1987). - Through your work at the Captured Music festival you did eat some people of the 'serious• electronic avant garde. How do you look at them and how do they look at a band like Pl604? Avant garde music of the 50 1 s and 60's was very innovative (and is still important today), Since the 70 1s the serious music is in sta;netion. New 8omenticism/New simplicity/ Minimal music/new age etc. ere all regressive. The traditional separation between composer and musician has been established again. Most of these people show a peripheral blindness. - Nowadays there are many so-called 'industrial' groups/projects, I think most oft these people are j ust into making noise or collage music without any underlying theory, What is your reaction to these bands, and what theories do you find of interest? Pl604 never considered themselves as 'industrials' (Inoustrialization is the history of the 19th centory), Knowledge and reflection of/on post-industrial society and art (and the relation bet ween them) is relevant for the work of Selektion, Especially received are the writings of the Germen 'Kritische Theorie' (Adorno etc,) and of structuralist/post structuralist writers, - One of the reasons that a lot of people know Pl604 is that you participated to a lot of compilations, What is your opinion towards compilations now, and to wards tapes in general (as you now make records only)? Tapes are essential for the worldwide commmnication of non-commercial music today, They are relativly easy to produce and distribute (co mpared to records for instance). On the other side tapes are dangerous: for the same reason it is sometimes too easy to record them. It's too easy to do anything and just release it on tape. That's the reason why we feel ambigous about tapes. As Pl604 wor ks very long on_every composition/ track we prefer to release our music on record (for the better sound-quality), And here it ends. Their next release will be (probably) t side of a double album to be released on RRRecords (USA), late 1987 (?), AsmuTs ietchens PART ONE by DOLFM" ULDER Everybody who hae a little insight in the 'industrial' or 'noise' music seene, may have noticed the following, Amongst ell kind of groups and individuals making this sort of music, since 1977, we find the names or people like Conrad Schnitzler and Asmus Tietchens. Both are musically active since the end of the 60's, trying to create a new music often by electronic or electroacousticel means, · I do not went to go into the question whether ·the germen electronic music of the ?O's was or any infiuence upon the 'industrial' music of the B01s. But I do want to give some attention to someone who knows both these worlds, es an invemtive representative, namely Asmus Tietchens (AT). by AT, 'Nechtstucke' (1980), produced by Baumann. Thie record contains melodious and harmonious tracks, music or a serious nature, with a very personal identity. The music is of great clearness, a quality or most of his music, This signifies that AT has strong musical ideas and is capable to translate them in music. 'Nachtstucke 1 is recorded et the Audiplex Studios in Hamburg. These are owned by Okko Bekker, a friend of AT, with whom he is working together for more than 15 years now.

Already announced in the first issue of Vital this second tape by this french group. T~eir first tape was a very spheric one, with dark and moody music.

He performed in Oen Helder tpgather with Szerkov, the bend behind Oe Koude Oorlog (The Cold War). I was not really aware of mister Merzidovsek's previous works, but whet he did was great, He used a prepared casio (which absolutly didn't sound like a casio) and some effect eqaipment, A strong, rh~thmic set he played, Szarkov did sound like Laibach in the old days, but on this live-event I did find it more ritual music, Slow flutes, dark voices and some various tapes.

Jupitter-Larsen The difference between noise, the recordings of noise, and any perception of noise is that there is far less difference between the vibrations of the subject and the documentation. Thoughts are every bit as concrete as the stuff twitching beside the mind. Mainly, there are two reasons for this. The first reason being, that those things which are mental are really just a specific kind of wave function. The other reason being, that those things which are physical are just another kind of wave function. These two wave functions being different, from each other, only in velocity. The only other kind of wave function there *is, being the state of nothingness; a function which doesn't move at all. Because that of the abstract, and that of the physical are both equally real for the same reason, it is the structure of understanding which is the agenda of debate. The act of how something is explained is the manner in which one gets accuracy through aesthetics. Debate is that specific event in which, the how in which something is explained, will be performed. Both that which is said and that which is not said being equal parts of the same algorithm. The efficiency or practicality of the explanation is completely dependent on the personal aesthetics involved in any given debate. Within my own personal aesthetic bias, there is only accuracy with a multidimensional interpretation. Any explanation being more accurate whenever it is being used only as a smaller division within that said larger event There always being more than a many explanations for any many a thing. However an explanation, regardless of context, only remains workable for those who are sensitive & agreeable to the aesthetics with which the explanation was fractionated from. Leonard mailed an audio cassette to Hugues. The recording was of Leonard calmly talking about the potential of wrestling as an unassuming engagement in continuous & contemplative thought The cassette was sent as a private personal audio-letter; however Hugues found the enclosed massage of great interest and used excerpts of it as part of a correspondence collaboration projecL Mailing people recordings, in order to have these people freely manipulate the material; as an approach to audio arrangement. It was a project that Hugues had started in order to do audio-art with friends of his who lived far abroad. The said excerpts were sent on to people like Stepan. In particular, Stepan in tum incorporated much of the excerpts in a sound sculpture which he had already been working on for some years. The sculpture was soon, thereafter, completed. It was later aired on radio; a broadcast which was accidentally heard by Leonard. An accident as Leonard and Stepan didn't know each other. While he was listening to clippings of his own words used as part of a stranger's virtu, Leonard got side-tracked; and he remembered that it was an organism's metabolism that was relative, not time. RECORD REVIEWS CIGURI - Compilation (Album on Odd Size). How to become famous - a lesson. You have your own group, quite some money to spend, and you want to be more known. You inv£te a couple of well-known bands, some unknown local ones and your first product is ready. This must be the thought of a new French label called Odd Size. The well-known ones are1 Asmus Tietchens, HNAS, Pl6 04, Poison Gas Research, Pacific 231. Local bands: Vox Populi!, Nox, ACEMS, Ureaming Together. Organising band: Eleva Modale. Their track reminds me of the best work of Esplendor Geometrico: herd, noisy rhythm. Other highlights: HNAS, this time not only sounding like Nurse With Wound, but also a bit like Severed Heads, including an american trying to speak germen! Pl6 04 is not doing some harsh collage music, but a very quite, almost ambient like noise piece. PGR togeth,er with Thessalonians have some weird piece, with weird guitar (no rock n roll !). A totally unknown group (for me) A.C.E.M.S. bring a nice sound-collage. There is one piece of this record which I didn't like: 'classical schocks' by Pacific 231. Cheaply treated classical music which does take unfortunally too much time, a very weak piece. But the rest is ranging from good to very good. Upcoming from this label is a compilation tape with 4 parisian bands and a compilation tape 'in memorial elvis presley'. We will keep you informed.

**VITAL 4**

NO COPYRIGHT PUBLICATION REPRINT NOW! 4 - Published by: Frans de Waard - Opaalstraat 19 - 6534 X!( Nij~egen - Holland Hello and welcome to Vital 4. The keyword to progress is called innovation, and as you can see the most important innovation here is that this Vital is entirely typed on a computer . We therefor hope to make a bit less mistakes. The main concern will always be to serve you as much as we can . Next appearance will be August the first. S.J ORGANISATION AUDIO& VISUAL PROJECTIO_N_S_ _ _ Production, distribution & Archives . In this Vital we would like to present an interview and a labelspot at once . A new l abe l which started off ear ly 1985. but started out a busy as the are now i n september 1986 . I n th i s very short time t hey are now amongst the most well-known labels: SJ ORGANISATION from Paris . France . We received very extended i nformation from t hem concerning the i r act i vities so most of this interview/ l abe l spot wi l l be based on quo t es from them. ' At first our aim was a product i on 1 label. There were very l ittle people involved in production of cassettes in France . There were only two dis tributors which seemt to be rea l ly interested in alternative/underground music: Vita Nova and Les Ballets Mecaniques. But they were mainly distributors and their activities as labels were very reduced . Vita Nova had been the first l abe l to bring cassettes from Girls In Fire or Tara Cross . Since VN disappeared , there was no ac t ive label left in France . The few wellknown/interest i ng bands like Le Syndicat or Pac i fic 231 were releasing their tapes on their own or on foreign l abels . Unfortunately, it was impossible t o f i nd any original release or European edition o f quite famous underground artis t s like Master/ Slave Relationship or Psyclones over here . We had t o do a label which cou l d bring an opportunity to these bands to spread ( American) music over here . This i s the reason why SJ Org decided to concentrate on re l easing cassettes from overseas artists. The hazard implied we had a large number of contacts i n the VS. so the cho i r.e was unquest i onab l e. We kept on •1elopping a l l t he forms of communication with the f oreign art i sts and decided to r e l ease over here what sounded new and exi ti ng t o us. Also SJ re l eases wor k from t he i r own musical pro j ect cal l ed La Sonorite Jaune .' What i s remarkable also . is the wide var i ety of music styles which are represented by SJ Org. ' From atmospheric to noise . from pop to untranslatable . we don't make ny difference between Rig Veeda and The -Twins and Big City Orchestra for example . Apart f rom the fact that one of the bands i s coming from Great Br i tain and the other from the VS. their music i s very different. but has the same origina l ity and power to us. We don ' t want to be exc l usive in our kind of mus i c . I f it makes the stars v ibrate . so we vibrate ! ' Another quest i on we asked t o SJ Org if t here i s any policy for re l easing t apes o r not releasing it: ' If the band i s t otally unknown that ' s great and it real ly doesn ' t matt e r. We don't care about the coamerc1al potential or the non-ccaiercial potential of the mus1c ... if we feel that there ~s something sincere. falling apart from the bad cliches of the so called industrial music. it's good for us. We don't want to miss the growing artists like Master/Slave Relationship or F/i. They are getting really famous in their own country (F/i's second LP was deleted one month after it's release on RRRl and they need european overtures. So we can try to bring this to them. Of course. the best would be for us to release an lp ... If it's impossible for now. we seriously think of this :or the future. Some of the artists we plan to release on LP are Maybe Mental, Big City Orchestra. Randy Greif, Master/Slave Rel ationship, F/i and some others. Of course, the choice is corresponding to our musical interests. but we try to see further. We want to he lp the artists who could be important. who have a real potential or originality . We are no i onger intersted in releasing anything from the first band which will get in touch with us. If we don 't release it on SJ Org. we wi ll anyway be OK for distributing it it ' s cassettes. ~hough it will have to be really worthwhile. Right now. we unfortunatly have less time than we had in our early days. It means that we now know what we want and that we can ' t find the time to release everyone ' s product who ' s getting in touch with SJ Org. So far. the situatio n is getting a little better . . . w1th more people involved in distribution of underground/ mail music. more interest on radios. That ' s great! • One of the main concerns of SJ Org was their own distribution. 'The SJ Organisation has also developped for one year a mail order distribution s 7rvice. This was split into 2 parts: distribution of cassettes in licence (these belong to the permament catalogue) and the other records and tapes we are buying at wholesale to distribute over here. This part of o~r organisation was taking too much time. So from now on we will slow down our rate .of distribution by mail order system in order to get more time to concentrate ourselves on the label and our own music. It means that we will keep the contacts with all the labels, that we will keep on ordering stuff. but that this stuff will be stocked in a shop in Paris (editors note: Les Etablissements Phonographiques De L'est - 115, Rue du Chemin Vert - 75011 Paris) and not on our catalogue anymore. It will provide us much more time to do so. So far. the activities of the SJ Org will sort of slow down on one hand to be more active on the other.• That this is true springs from the fact that I never heard about the1r radio interest . 'One other activity of SJ Org is the creation of radio network with some american radios The principle of the radioshow is · that this is not a 'commercial radioshow' but an experimental hour and a half. We are asking to bands to send sou~d material (this can be loops, environmental sounds. or whatever sound source we can use) and we are improvising with our own environmental recordings. found sounds. etc. These kind of radioshows are happening on severa l radios around the world. and each radio is using the same tracks. loops. tapes ... Phone contributions are planned. aswell as simultaneous transmissions . The headquarters for this radio network is at UBUIBI/DAS ( 1803 Mission Street - 154 Santa Cruz. Ca 95060 - USA). Of course. the soundrnaterial has to be send to any of the labels invlolved in the network and this label wil l send dubs to all the other radios. So far. KZSC (responsible: Das), WZBC (resp: RRR/ Due Process ). WCRT (resp: Manny Theiner) and some others are involved in the project. Of course. SJ Org is also involved in the project through Radio Libertaire in Paris . All informations will be spread by Ubuibi and SJ Org. We are looking for radios to be also involved in this project . ' I know only a few people who start a label. just to start a label: there is always a music project involved, and SJ Org is not an exception. The music project of Zin-Kaia and Orange Princess (as the members of SJ Org VITAL call themselves) is called LA SONORITE JAUNE. 'Our ma1n influence doesn't come from music but from different ways of e~pression linkable with art. and especially painting. Yves Klein and Kadinsky have probably been our two ~argest influences. Klein.through his installation 'Ci Git L'Espace'. has shown something which can be interpretated in different ways. For us, he has definatly burried the untranslatable space. We have wondered if there was another space behind the 'dead/material space' and we found one. This new space is called the parallel universe. It gathers all the physical elements of interstellar/outer spaces and all the terrestrial elements which will be mixed to create an atmosphere outside time/space/ movement which is well-known to us. We are manipulating the elements to make them defy time/space/movement and try to recreate them elsewhere in another dimension that we call parallel universe. There is a part of dream. too ... since our music is a deviance of personal interpretations of all the used environmental elements as well as a personal and intimate exploration of ideas suggested by Klein and Kadinsky. The way to get into the paralllel universe is quite simple but not necessary obvious . Why? Just because the emotional contents of our tracks comes from the use of environmental sounds. They are pieces of life. as it is. as we live it . We are exploring through a wall of sounds and colours the different forms of perception of reality. The fact of using these analysis as a synthesis ot' its basic elements gives to the body a new sensitivity. a new approach of sounds and sensations. This new blend is a part of the new dimensional space that we try to reach. This is the reason why we are connecting all of this with a sort of outer space. The 'terrestrial' sounds are all in all a mark which shows that one can use these as a point of departure to go into a personal interpretation of the music/atmosphere. We are igniting the process and let the things come. In a less formal approach ·. the ' space VITAL . . I ., i P . f.l oe ry writings bring a personal vision of the parallel universe. Once a~a1n. there are a lot of conncetions with outer spaces and interstellar overdrives. as well as fairy tales.We are describing elements supposed to make _you feel leaving the reality to get into a total abandon of the body functions. as well as a wandering of the spirit . This is the part of dream generated once again by the sounds supposed to show you a way. Eli~he (which is track on the forthc~ m1ng ~lbum Je Ne Veux Plus Voir Le Ciel, with on the other side Lt. Caramel - ed.). the result of the audition of the outer spaces. is the solution to move into the new space/time/ movemen~ dimension. It's like a gate of sounds and colours and you are .t he only one to decide if you feet l ike crossing it. This is just an act of love. La Sonorite Jaune has recorded some cassettes in collaboration with other artists. Our collaboration with The Haters from Vancouver was the extreme explanation of what a breakdown of _the parallel universe could be. This universe is easy to destroy by the force of will . The Haters did it. An upcoming collaboration with the amercian ar~ist John Hudak will ins i ~t on ano~her state of the parallel universe. Things and events are regenerating again and again. as a endless loop. More musicians have shown interest in a collaboration with us. • Their many plans include their first album and a compilation serie with US groups .

The intellectual grasp of the senses and more in particular the hearing (that is: language ) is related to th~ cultural leve l of society. Wel l . it has to be said: the ear is in a savage state . 4 - The only valuable characteristic of history is modernity . 5 - The alternative: creating or realising a language gives us the problem of the exchange between producer and listener; the problem of communication . 6 - The raw sound. incorrect ly cal led noise. is the measure of man. The conceived sound , or music. is l ike the measure of man· s inte ll igence or of some other obscure gift . a - In the first case it is an intergrated part of man' s l 1f e and asks for the attention one gi ves t o wel l known things. b - In the second case : it demands and gets ho l d. 7 - What is. in a century i n which synthetics trium-ph . the ro le of impetuousness? 8 - a Today we see noise orgenized , mingled . reverberated . b Today we hear sound that comp l ies with the demands of rea l ity . c Today we see a music which is neither a refusal nor acceptance of itself but which imposes itself unthe same title as communication in the most modern fashion : the electroaccoustic. 9 - By man's modern standard. a music which is a style because it is imp l icit in man ' s contemporary sound manifestation . Pierre Henry . march 1952 VITAL l - When you have nothing to say. say nothing. Sampled music 1s not 1Dus1que concrete. 2 - What could have become the new style-movement of post-war music has unfortunately died a premature death. Rock 'N' Roll and later pop arrived. Within 36 years music changed from an artistic expression into a factorymade pastime. 3 - The idea behind e l ectro-accoustic music is in fact the only logical step when we cons1der the evolution of 19th and 20th century art. Electro- accoustics deal with real life brought into an abstract musical context . 4 - Electro-accoustic music deals with concrete all - day sounds in an abstracted form . in order to reveal the beauty of the a li -day sounds in their all-day context . 5 - a What do we do that has been done before wi t hout our know1ng it? And is that i mportant? b What don ' t we know that we shou ld know to make more releveant music mus i c ? When you have nothing to say. etc . .. 6 - What Henry and h is co l league Schaeffer achieved w:th their development of the electro-accoustic musical system was the comp l etion of the search for more and richer soundcol ours in ( class i cal ) music. a search that had been going on ever s i nce music existed . 7 - Peop le have grea t di ffi cul t y with accept i ng the f act t ~at t he sound of sighs. bangs . crack l e. or squeaks cou ld be l is t ened to as serious components i n a musica l composit i on. They refuse all-day sounds a place in musical context. they refuse to see al l -day sounds as things that can be beautiful . 8 - The words of Henry are still valab l e. At this moment l ots of people are in the pos1tion to make electroaccoustic mus1c. simp le because the most basic equ i pment is easily availab l e . 9 - Listen to beauty of the sounds in your environment. Let us then continue what has started in 1948. Jos Smol ders, march 1988 The piece on the previous page was submitted by Jos Smolders. Some introduction about h1s person and music 1s needed. He 1s a member of Thu 20. a dutch group, on which we did write a lot in the past. This group of 5 persons have a stro ng interest 1n musique concrete and music related to this . All members of Thu 20 are also acti ve with solo-activities. The output of Jos Smolders is the greatest of them all. He calls himself loss for his solo-act1ves. So far he has released the following tapes: Yes Yes Oh Yes (on Midas Tapes). I Could Be God (on Delftsche Wormen Tapes) . Mama - A Study Of Human Tongue (on Midas Tapes) and Scrtchd (Konn Plastics) . One of the developments in his music is that it is becomer more and more quite music. no harsh. industrial music but quite. electronic things, not 0 to be compared w1th Eurock music ! Right now loss is also involved in a new proJect called !MCA. which stands for Internat1onal Musique Concrete Assemb ly . Th1s 1s not a normal mail music pro j ect . but a proJect in which initial recordings are processed severa l times by several people . I t is imposs1ble to give more details yet. but in future Vitals wil l be surely discuss the off-shoot of this . An activity by Jos Smolders himse l f is called EAR. which stands for Electro Accoustic Research. This will be an organisation for the promotion of musique concrete, i.e. l ive-act i vties aswell as other projects . Send an IRC for more information . l oss is also i nterested in taking part in compi l ation projects. but he told me that he prefers serious theme compi l ations only ! The above mentioned tapes are available, except ' I Could Be God' which is sold out (but then again there were only 15 copies). For more 1nformation send an IRC to: Jos Smolders Kapelmeesterlaan 483 5049 NE Ti lburg Holland LOR TEEPS This is the name of a new dutch label to which we would like to point your attention to. Recently they have released three new tapes . The first two are compilations : The Death Project Volume One and Volume Two. On these two you can mainly find dutch artists. like: Odal. Kapotte Muziek. Ova Met Ova Nichts. Post Mortem, The H.E.S . S. Group, (these are all on vol . 1). Boris. One Voice. Dust And The Minds. Vital Parts. Salo Mentale, Forbidden Photographes . Some of the foreign names : Hagzisse. Die Rache. Exterminator. The Haters . One volume 1 the music is quite industrial. with all kinds of feedback and delays, On volume 2 you will find more more experimental music, according to chef du !able, Jan Kees . 0.K. one might call it experimental. I call it pleasant to hear ! Both volume 1 and 2 will come in a big bag with visual stuff. Then we received a th1rd tape. Thi s is a joint tape by Odal and Post Mortem (- Jan Kees himself ). The last one fills the entire A-side with the handclapping of peop le along with some mysterious sounds. Who are they clapping for : the listener who can give all his attent1on to this (joke of course ! ) . Oda! on the b-side is going back to his earlier period of loud noisy stuff (in comparison with his more recent sampled works) and fragments from films. It ' s o.k . . but he can do better. This tape comes with a booklet with visuals. Lor Teeps is now working on a compilat1on with WAR as the leading theme. Al so planned is a new tape by Little Seed (more normal new wave from Jan Kees ) and Friends In Low Places. This last one is surprising because this group did exist some years ago, but. according to my information. ceased to exist long ago. Could be good . I guess. Finally Jan Kees also releases a magazine, called Dwarsligger, unfortunatly it is in ducth. Send an !RC for more info: Lor Teeps L. Nicasiustraat 4 Amersfoort Holland VITAL ~ RECORD ECSTACY BY CURRENT !Compilation album on Schizophoni4 .sch 8801). Discontent to the compilotions around 1nade Lud from West Berlin decide to compile his own compilation record. 'Ecsta cy By Current' is the title of what will be a serie of compilations. Submissions can be made but remember: Lud is not interested in just some harsh. industrial music. but experimental. good listenable music. From about 200 submissions he compiled this first volume. 'Experimental - Good L1stenable' it says on the cover and I must admit Lud is right. To a certain extent this is experimental. but for someone who has experienced a lot of experimental or industrial music, this won ' t shock you. Very positive on this record is also the fact that Lud did choose for some very unknown names. Who ever heard of Memorandum. Subtle Reign. Dim. Retire (from Greece ! ) and Beat The Material or Solanceae Tau? More well-known names are Jeff Greinke. Randy Greif and Kathars1s. Most ot the bands here work with sampled sounds ( like Memorandum. which sound very much like La1bach) and sampled music always gives a strong rhythmic feeling to a record. The ' good listenable' part certainly 1s related to rhythmic music. I guess. My personal favourites are Dim. Retire with their piece with many vocals (which makes it almost into soundpoetry ) and G. Park. who i s working with concrete sounds . G. Park 1s certainly the most silent part of this record. Naming some favourites doesn't mean that I dislike the rest! I certainly think this is a good record. and I'm very curious to hear the following volume and of course hope to experience again some new. unknown name s. Address: Schizophonia - Grosbeerenstrasse 90 - 1000 Berlin 61 - West Germany SIGILLUM S - BOUDOIR PHILOSOPHY (Album on ADN Record~ dll 004). Ritual music? How can it be described? I find it a very hard matter . I hope you can ima gine what ritual music is. or better I give you one name for reference: Current 93. This band REVIEWS must be very popular in Italy, knowing the fact that all lot of bands do sound like Current 93. Mumbling voices. deep far away drums. deformed gregor1an chants. Imagine that and you know what Sigillum S sound like. But I must say that they don't sound as a cheap imitation of the 'big master '. but I find it very hard to say were exactly the imitation stops and that they start to develop their own sound. This is a good record. in fact much better. than a older tape which I know fact much better than a older tape which I have from them which sounded more like 'normal' electronic music. if you understand what I try to say. There is however one thing that I don ' t understand: The cover is black and white on dark pink paper. but inside YOU will find a really beautiful photograph in full colour . Why didn ' t they put that one on the cover? Address: ADN - Piazzale Segrino. 6/a - 20159 Mi l ano -I taly. DE FABRIEK/FORCE DIMENSION - FABFORCE (7"EP on De Fabriek Records and Tapes) . One of the last products from the dutch group De Fabriek (rumour has it that they will stop soon) and the first product from a new dutch group Force Dimension on a joint 7" . To start with the last one: they use synthesizers and rhythm machines, in order to create 'danceable ' music. which could very wei l be. but due to low dynamics of this 7 ". the dance music doesn ' t jump out of my boxes . De fabriek are heading towards a new episode in their music after their industrial music ( like on Made In Spain) . But what kind of music ? This is very hard to say, a fine mixture of noise (oh yes indeed). but also tickling hippie guitars (acoustic ! ) . which proves that De Fabriek cannot be caught in one specific style ! Also the cover is great: handpainted paper. with photograph. And incense ! I f this is not like the good-old-days then I don't know either. This 7" is released in a limited edition of 250 copies. so one should hurry . Address: De Fabriek - Postbus 1135 - 8001 BC Zwolle - Holland VITAL TAPE REVIEWS THE LAST FAITH Cc60 Compilation on Soundfume Tapes). On this compilation you will find four belgian groups. of which one has quite some reputation. Vidna Obmana. The other three are unknown until now. Anybody interested in some music ala Whitehouse? He/she should buy this tape. because to me it seems as if all four are inspired by this notorius british band. I like this tape aswell as a lot of other music which springs from the roots of Whitehouse. Also available from this label is a tape Vidna Obmana. Kapotte Muziek and The Grey Wolves. Upcoming tapes are by Le Syndicat and Victorim. Address : Dirk Serr1es - Parijslaan 173 - 2710 Hoboken - Belgium PGR/THESSALONIANS - IMBRICATION 2(c? on Angakok) . A strange tape. it is sold on a c54 which has music on side one for 25 minutes and on the b-side for about 6 minutes. On the cover it says that these are re-mixes from a soon to appear record. called ' The Black Field '. which. to my knowledge hasn't been released yet . It also says 'One night 1n the studio a curious thing happened ... I stumbled upon a process that revealed dialogue between autonomous pieces of improvised music . I call this process accidental imbrication.' A wonderful. but indeed strange kind of improvised music is what you will find on this tape . Needless to say. that it is good! Address: Angakok - 781-28 Fujigokaro - Kash1wa Shi 227 - Japan. SOCIEDADES EN TETRA BRIK - LOLITA (c46 on Tetra Brik Recor's). Again a new project. from Spain (a very, very active country) . Packed in a small sized computerbox with colour xerox. they musically offer. some typical 's panish ' music: harsh rhythms. disturbed radiosounds. screaming vocals. You might think that Esplendor Geometrico were the only ones to make this. but these guys prove that in fact anyone can make this kind of music. without sounding as an imitation or something like that. Address: c/o Biel Olivier - c/Luis Marti. 130 Atico - Palma De Mallorca. VITAL SWAB SOUND HORROR-. CHANCE DYING !c40 on Ultimate Skin Labs). This is their second tape (see Vital 2 for the first one). and it 1s quite an improvement ! Whereas the previous tape had quite 'ideas·. on this tape the ideas are developped into two great pieces. This 1s fine and unique blend of acoustic sounds. radio noise. tapeloops and all although one may find that this sounds like Nurse With Wound. I think it sure has it own style. Rumour has it that these guys are also working on their first album! Address: Ultimate Skin Labs - Malvert 73-12 - 6538 DK Nijmegen - Holland. ESRUK - SEVERE (c60 on Dendrite Tapes). A very unknown project from Canada with. if I'm correctly. only one person involved. On this tape you' 11 find at first some experiments with a synthesizer. For me this 1s the weakest part from the tape. The rest of this is filled with 'mixing 13 year old 4 track tapes'. I am not sure whether I understand this. but I must admit that it is very good. The music is very hard to describe. all kinds of unrecognizable sounds whirl in and out. put together as a long collage. I recommend this to everyone ! Address: Ben Wilkin - 2709 Venables - Vancouver BC - Canada V5K 2RS. FACTOR X - UNTITLED Cc46 on Indespa1r Recordings). Another highly unknown project. this time UK based. The cover doesn ' t reveal much about it. but I think this is a project from the guy behind this l abel. Obscure noises and rad1osounds . Not surprisingle new but altogether a fine. listenable tape.

NO COPYRIGHT PUBLICATION REPRINT NOW! VITAL 5 Published by: Frans de Waard - Opaalstraat 19 - 6534 XK Nijmegen Holland Still expanding! For this Vital we would like to thank Jae for doing an interview with Giancarlo Toniutti and Jos for looking for all our mistakes. Our next issue will probably have 'soun dpoetry' (music related to ... ) as a leading theme. Next appearance will be November the first. Giancarlo Toniutti The following interview with Giancarlo Toniutti was done by Jae. Because of the clearness of the questions. I will not give an introduction to the person of Giancarlo. - What is your musical background? Do you ever do live-performances. and if so. in what form? Musical background can be divided in 3 sections : al listening, bl study cl working. For the first. there is not much to say . I mean. I won 't go on with the li sts of names I was or am interested in. I can ju st say I started with electronic music. while at the moment I'm absolutely more interested in electroacoustic works . But I listen to environments with the same · interest. For the second I studied electronic music in Venice during 1982-85. It gave me a good basic knowledge in psychoacoustics. acoustics. sound analysis etc & it also pushed me out of electronics. as sound generators (it ha s been as a distinction to all that computer practice). For the third. everything started with absolutely free acoustic improvisation with a friend of mine (back in 19771. But I have no musical background really, since I can't play any traditional instrument and I have no interest in learning to. The most important thing is that my background is mainly outside of music . after all (much more morphology etc). Regarding live performances: I have made 4 live sound actions so far. Quoting them I will give you a simple and clear idea of what I can work on. live: 15.6.84: Udine - La Mutazione (30') for mag netic tape & visual action; 9.9 . 84: S.Giorgio di !ogaro CUD) - Un Piccolo Organismo (30') for 2 voices and echo devices; 24.3.8 5: Udine - 0 Nekotoryx Struktury (3 5 ') for magnetic tape and 2 stones; 25.3.86: Roma - Septikos Spinale (30') for sound sources and loop tapes. One more was conceived. but then cancelle d. It was 13 .5 .86: Milano - Sinechia Microcanonica (60') for v oice . circular device & metallic wire. But I've been considered a bad perso n and the date was cancelled. Now there is a possible date for a new action: - Pantigliate (MI) - Microclinale (30') for pipe, small objects. bassdrum and video. We' 11 see if it can be realized. Regarding this matter I can add that live-performances are not my main interest. I rarely accept invitations and when I do it's because it could give me the chance to explore a certain interest, a certain condition (so a certain process). I'm not much interested in direct contact with and response from the public. Anvway these sound actions have all in common that they are about employing processes. designed and conceived esp ecially for that situation and occasion and never will be repeated I could explain in detail every single action VITAL w process. but it would be longer than a metre of soap What do you think of the experimental music of today? Do you see any progression in music and attitudes? In my opinion there aren't many interesting things now (anvway in the past it was not that either). I mean, there is still a s1milar attitude with a lot range of people. Many persons realize things Just with the idea of coming out with a pair of tracks. doing something musical or whatever similar. This is basically a rock attitude. even when covered (sometimes only partially) by an exteriorly different halo; it is still the same. What is more annoying is the fact that in any movement there are new people who intend to present the new music, the new idea. the revolution. the movement of the century etc . Apart from the fact that this is absolutely untrue of any of their acts/realizations. the worst is that in this way the only result is ju st a different cover for the same matte r. The form is a lways the same . I really see very few people who work into structure , as well as into soundgeneration , as well as into global approac h. People usually take as many standards as possible . I 'm sure very few peop l e know (and with rea son for ) why a certain sound micro even t occurs or exists or has been placed on a certain moment or point into one of the tracks. Many people simply do what they feel as good. No com.~ent on this. Absolutely embar.-asing ! About progression. what else can be sa id in this sens e? An important thing is that I hope no ' progression' will occur, but just a linear attitude. What I hope for. is that in near future there will be an atomization of the scene. in all possible direc tions (centrifugal as well as centripeta l etc.). This atomization, thi s micro-division. must be individual (as author, editor etc.) - and this is partly already going on, within a certain area - as well as of meaning form (1n the sound working itself). As many theories as possible could give a relevant attitude to music (or what one could call music). - Of course you have favourite artists. I don't want to hear their names but maybe you can tell me what you like particulary in their music. and in what way this has influenced your own music. How did your music style arise? Some of the things I'm interested in. as part of an author's work, could also exist within my sound working. Because of a similar approach (in that specific field) depending on coincidences or appreciations or collaborations. But areas of interest can also be only part of a certain authors work and not pertaining to my own activity, because of a globally different direction. Furthermore. I can say that only within the microlife of an author's work (within the micro-cosmos of a sound working) these similarities can indeed exist, without any problems. The form. the structure has to have a specific and unique approach, otherwise no real contact between author and work can exist . Anvway, there are various interests have in music and outside of music. And of course the most intere sting ones usually tend to be lumped together into my own working. Not as pure (mere) influen ces. but as homotopies (simil ar pathways). What I'm especially interested in (and now I speak as a listener and not as author ) is the existence of a substratum of dynamics (of course as author this matter is of great importance to me). This could be within a punctual dynamic or within an ambient dynamic or within some thing else. But always in respect of the fact that to me soundworks become interesting when they overpass the threshold of music and reach the condition of sound environments (literally). Regarding my 'musical style': there ' s no other way to really reply to this question, than abstractly. To me every style always comes from consequent appriomations to current ideas ( these ideas swallowing lots of different intuitions. reflections etc.) in an unlinear motion obviously when useful rationalizations arise (often people rationally plan a style, which is shameful) . - Your 2nd record 'Epiginesi' comes with a booklet containing very nice pictures and some incomprehensible texts (because of it's 'scientifi c ' character). This way you will only reach a very small reading audience (intellectuals). Please try to explain the link (if there is any) between your music and text. Well. first of all I don't think I'll only reach a very small reading audience, because of the complexity of my essays. If there is a small reading audience, it's J ust a matter of fact on which I have no moral judgement for. Surely I hope this audience does not consists of intellectuals (or people regarding themselves as such). I'm absolutely sure that any field of my activity can be perceived & understood by anyone in the world. It's (partly) a question of app roach. All of my ' scientific' language is more literal than you think. The link between the sound & the information: obviously, concerning my essay on sound generation and construction, the link is highly present and also obvious . The text really explain s my way of working, within a global view on the phenomenon and local activity within the phenomenon. For the linguistic essay, the link is more on a theoric level; of course. My linguistic interests are highly relevant to my sound working, because of the approa ch systems and the theoretical morphological view These studies. as well as others . give me a larger spect rum and a wider field to perceive and construct the local and global structures of my works . Of course the link between sound working and information in an essay is abstract. in terms of semantic fields. There is no didascalic activity. Because sound has a meaning in itself and within the structure it grows semantically. The theoretical works conveys homotopic meaning s (or fields of meaning) .Clear enough? ---------, VITAL~ -Do you think it is important to connect music with a lot of information? Why can't music be enough to entertain people? Or is entertainment not the main point? Why, do you think. are there more and more artists using underlying theories in their music 7 Is it a new dimension to music? It is not important;it all depends on the author's activity (or kinds of). If someone has such theoretical background needing a textual form , I think it will be necessary to him to give this theoretical background an existence before the 'audience' .E.g .. I absolutely don ' t understand why people give all the technical data sometimes like what kind microphone. tape -record er, instrument or sound obJect is used etc. When the se data are not really structural or functional to the project itself. There is a large range of musicians or artists (as they like to call themselves) that is using a 'nee-poetics of the object' (as Maurizio Bianchi called it) giving a more important to what they use than to the morphology of the work. This i s a very bad tendency nowadays. I repeat myself only when it is functional and structural (and above all : meaningful) to my work. that report of data concerning that project should be given. Anvway, you mention music as entertainment. This way, obviously, music is enough in itself, and needs no theoretic background. The fact however is that entertainment has no part in my sound works, and in sound working as I think of. E.g. i s an environment entertaining? Could it be defined as entertainment? The same for sound works. Depending on the answers you give, you can understand why the existence of a theoretic background can be (in a certain way) necessary. Sound works mean something! ! And if someone knows why and how.he/she ( it ) can find it interesting.relevant (and maybe necessary ) to write down his/ her(its) view and ideas. But of cours e this is not an absolute truth. Someone could prefer to be silent. Highly respectable ! ! It is. I think. a trend now. that people think of the working with information as a new moVITAL vement (the audio-art movement). While, as I wrote above. this is very often just a question of trend (of sheep) and didascalism (descriptivism). there 1s no new dimension in music (which dimension, after all ?) because of 'information'. It is just working with sound (and in other fields) with a complex multi-focal attitude (the 'science art' in Xenakis' view) . - Do you foresee any development in your music? Please tell us also about your future releases? I have seen a great development in my sound approach and working. Therefor I can guess future development. For sure I won ' t go through linear development . Then , for sure, I will work in different fields at the same time. There can be no definite direction, as simply described by a vector . I can say however I work a lot with the acoustic sound genesis (no use of electronics here). I can 't say if this is a definitive give up of electronics, of course. anyWay. But my current working i s with the acoustic range with various approaches. I naturally try to work out sound environments using characters of multifocality, granularity etc. that environments have by their own. It ' s not a question of simulation ! ! My sound works will become real sound envirorunentsin stead of simulated environments. And above all what interests me is morphology and morphogenesis and perception. This is something I'm going to develop (study & apply) on and on. Very recently (for 2 tracks for 2 compilation records) I worked with ' rare morphologies '. but I can ' t go on about these subjects without increasing the complexity of my wr it ing. But what is important to say is that I have projects planned already , that will engage me for quite a long time (so deve l opments are. in a sense. already planned ). Most of these projects are collaborations (active col laborations. not simp l e exchange of materials) . - In April I worked the whole month on my collaborative proJect with Conrad Schnitzler. It 1s a work that has started in 1985 and ended this April '88. blending together my & his attitude. with references to each other's one. as a link. A quite moving and mani-folded work (history !) .Now that it is ready I hope to find a label interested 1n releasing it as an LP (Probably through Discos Esplendor Geometrico - ed). - A planned LP with Andrew Chalk, which is near to completion.I hope it will be done 1n a couple of months. We worked in 1987 and again now in 1988. It's an interesting project, but I don't like to give details on my current projects. I just can say it will be a very environmental, quiet and organic work. It will pos sibly be released through RRRecords in co-production. - A planned installation: sound & photos; and a documentary double LP+ book box set. with Enrico Piva. We are now starting to collect materials taking photos. and organizing the events. It is obviously a huge work so it will take quite a while. But I hope it can be done within a year's work. It will be a very architectural and coherent and field-recorded work, for what I can say now. The installation will a lmost surely take place at my home (in an adequate space). but I can 't say when , yet. The release of the double LP+ book box-set will probably be done through a co-production with Freedom In A Vacuum label. - There is a planned LP with Siegm ar Fricke. We started the theoretic work some months ago and are now collecting what we need as sound sources. This is going to become a very rigorous work and I won ' t give details of it. As a forecast, it will be absolutely in high rigor, very peculiar and very concrete (in a literal sense ). No label . so far. for re l ease . - My planned third personal LP (+ book) . For the moment. especially because of the other projects . this is highly at a theoretic level. But it wil l imply surely all the theoretic work I 'm doing from now. Quite probably a self release. No details now. All here Here it ends. the longest piece ever in Vital. Write to Gianc arlo himself. he has most of the releases. on which he appears available himself . Giancarl o Toniutti Via Sistiana 29 ·33100 Udine Italia RECORD REVIEWS FACE TO FACE VOL.lCAlbum on Odd Size) This is the second release by this label from Paris. On this record you will find two artists each filling one side. One side is filled by Asmus Tietchens who contributed two long pieces. Both pieces are build from rhythmic synth pulses. Also in both pieces there are other sounds from synthesizer used. Yet both pieces differ: the first is calm and minimal whilst the second is more aggressive. Not real harsh industrial but nevertheless aggressive. The other side is filled by Die Form. According to the cover this is music for a film, called Animal Instinct. Die Form uses samplers and micro composers. At times very rhythmic (what else can you expect from samplers), but also with calmer sounds (though not too many). Good for those who like Die Form. Address: Laurent Perrier - 6 Rue Dupuis - 75003 Paris - France DOC WOR MIRRAN - DEADTHINGS IN LOVE (7" EP on Empty Records). This is their second EP . The first one was much more punk music, but this music is more industrial orientated . It contains 6 tracks which all end in lock-grooves. The music itself is based on repetition . This record will be released in several editions which will all have different covers . When an edition is sold out, a new one will be made. The music is the best tribute to Boyd Rice I have heard until now. Address: Empty Records - Muggenhoferstr. 39 - 8500 Nurnberg - West Germany ~tR,4l' '<-'If~ 0 d .... z 1' 0 0 ' GR E S s GENERATEDP ROGRESSION- GENERATED PROGRESSION (Album on Mission Papua Holland Records ). This is a project from R. Henderson . In the past he was a member of Three Mad Dog, a band which involved music (mainly metal percussion) with video and film. This band does not exist any longer and R. Henderson decided to work for himself and after a period of money saving he now has presented his first record. He is still influenced by percussion music. Monotone. ritual drumming can be found on some of the presented tracks here. The drumming pieces are refering to Het Zweet, Test Dept or Z'ev. But that's only half of the record. For the other tracks he mainly uses synthesizer (of a dark nature) and voices. If I am not mistaken is the track Chronos 1 only voice, but all highly deformed. In the track Reise In Die Vergangenheit also a piano is used. At times I wished the final mix had been done better, but nevertheless this is a good record , and it is to be hoped that it sells good, so we can expect another one ! The price is only 15 dutch guilders, including post and package (in Europe !) , so that should not be a reason for not buying it. Address: R. Henderson - PO BOx 1672 - 5200 BS Den Bosch - The Netherlands ZONDIG (Album on Midas Music ). This is the first record project from a label which we presented in the first Vital. This record project is a compilation. On this record you wil l 13 contributions, from which 7 originate from Holland: very good. The more well known bands on this record (Etant Donnes. Blackhouse, The Haters ) will make it easier to sell it, and it i s giving the more unknown bands a chance to get heard. Most of the bands here fall into what I can easily call 'industrial' music. But there are under lying differences: Ova Met Ova Nichts and PDM are on the most extreme loud side, while Thu 20 is more collage music , and Blackhouse is using ' real ' rhythm . So I. it ' s very diverse. And therefore a good album to buy (if you want to s~art in 'i ndustrial ' music, or if you want to check out those dutch bands. ). Upcoming projects from Midas Music include a 7" EP by Merzbow and a 7" EP by Kapotte Muziek.

This is the 6th release from a label from Germany, that has spent a great deal on making a very good release. Their catalogue of releases is therefore very small, but all of high quality. This tape is copied on cro2 and has a very well done cover . Enrico Piva is. I believe. a member of Amok. From this project I know one release (on AON). which is an ambient music project. with the use of many sounds from nature. This project of Piva was also recorded somewhere in nature. but the music is based on loops or sampling. Partly a quick rhythmic effort (withhout being danceable), but minimal. Address:R. Kasseckert - Im Haselbusch 56 - 4130 Moers 2 - West Germany PCR - IN THE LAND OF CERBERUS (c60 on Prion Tapes). This is their third release. They are usually compared with Laibach. but that cannot be said of this tape. They present here a very moody, da r k music. There are synthesizers p · aying their darkest tones & howling guitars. Most of the music is instrumental, but you can derive from titles like 'In der Nacht sterben' (dying in the night) that this is certainly not a funny or pleasant. NOT recommended to any person with suicidal thoughts ! Address:Prion Tapes -c/o Peter Schuster - Speyererstr.16 - 8500 Nurnberg - West Germany THE HATERS - SWEET AUSTERITY (c60 on Nihilistic Recordings). I never did make a secret of the fact that The Haters are my personal favourites. and that I am particular fond of their live recordings. Which is what can be found on this tape. Side one opens with two shorter pieces. with a kind of sampled noise, and some noise from (I guess) a guitar.This side ends with a very long. dark piece with very dark noise, with all kinds of bangs on it. This kind of noise can also be found on side 2. A must for all Haters fans. Address: Peter Zincken - Groen and 87 - 1560 CV Zaandam - Holland (The editor of this pamphlet 1s still searching for two Haters tapes: Per - formance and P11tu Lintunen. Who can help?) blackhumour - BINARY CANO/OR) (c60 on Nihilistic Recordings). From the same label as above is this tape from a very good friend from The Haters. But unlike The Haters. blackhumour uses only voices. According to the cover of this tape, only digital and analog editing is used. no reverb, effects or speed or back-masking. Incredible, is the only word I can think off. A thick, intense. massive sound, and only with voices? This tape belongs to he best I heard since a very long time. Highly recommended. Address: as above. SADOMAOISTAN- l.MAI 1985-1.MAI 1988 (c20 on Requiem). Never heard of this band before. They offer 4 tracks on this tape. The first one is probably the most acceptable: dance rhythms with vocals and synth (all vocals in Norwegian). The second is about the same, but much more chaotic. The first track on the b-side is recorded live. and has much more guitars in it. thus sounding like all those new garage bands. The last piece is based on vocals on the foreground. and is a bit doomy. So actually four tracks which differ a lot from each other. but that is not bad at all (better than such a tape with all of this kind of music). Address: Requiem - Jens Bjelkesgt.62c - 0656 Oslo - Norway VIDNA OBMANA- THE FACE THAT MUST DIE (c60 on Soundfume Tapes). An active unit is this Vidna Obmana . He puts out many tapes, and mainly in the genre of hardcore electronics. But. despite his young age, he has worked on this project for about 2 years. On the cover it says: Mechanical Orchestration Music. Whatever that is. This is certainly not loud, industrial music, but more quite music, ritual so to say. I find it very hard to describe anyway and I think that it is something you have to listen to yourself. Take my word for it that it is good.

LABELS POT: I must say that I dont know many american labels which have released only good tapes. Most of the labels have quite weak stuff. cheap imitations from European projects. I would like to present one of my favourite labels from the USA: BANNED PRODUCTIONS. This piece is partly based on the tapes that I heard. and partly on a letter which I received. 'Banned Productions grew out of my involvement in mail art in about 1982 /83. As I grew more and more bored with the mail art mentality,! put more emphasis on banned and that "scene". In the beginning, all the tapes where done by me under a variety of titles. They were. for the most part, the typical power-noise-nazi-manson type stuff. When I grew tired of being angry and realizing that this was just flogging a dead horse of a different hide, I decided I needed a change. I started releasing tapes by people and groups whose work I enjoyed on some level. like the Haters and Blackhumour. I also started doing a lot of collaborations with friends, resulting in such projects as amk/pgr amk/gx, amk/das and s o on.' The tape which Banned released from the Haters is a double c60, with live recordings made in the US in the period 1981-1986. Good recordings, showing the better side of the Haters. And soon there will be another live tape from the Haters. this time with recordings from last year. The tapes from Banned are always packed without the usual plastic boxes, but in paper/carton envelopes, which you have to rip apart before you can listen to the tapes . The amk/pgr/aem tape is packed in a nice small carton box with a full colour cover and 4 black and white photos. AMI<a bout the packages: 'I package my tapes the way I do, simply because I like adding a different dimension to the whole experience. I don't see any reason why someone would sped months on the music and then 5 minutes on the package ' But Gerald (from the Haters) told me that another reason was also that the listener/consumer has to do some action in opening the package before starting to listen to the tape. The tape which 1s released by Nicolas Ri>a 1-i 11. e C!] f·:>RODUCTIO · Collins is called 'Real Landscape'. and is, of course packed in a map. It consists of recordings made during the Europe tour by Collins. The title refers to John Cage's work 'Imaginary Landscape'. Collins uses short bits and pieces from the radio. which were then fed through sampling/delay's. The result is a almost funny Boyd Rice. A good release. 'I've put out two compilations so far and I' 11 probably do another one in the near future. The first one. 'In Another Context'. showed off the wide variety of 'sound text/poetry' with everyone from the Grey Wolves to John Trubee. The second one. 'Out Of Context'. focused on soundtracks ranging from pgr to Ramleh. The third one: I haven't decided yet; Compilations are really difficult and time-consuming to do right. so I want to do one that I can put up with working on for years'. Banned also released a tape by Merzbow. our japanese hardcore noise friend. But on this release he is working with more traditional instruments and all kinds of drumming. One of his better works is presented. But Banned is no longer really interested in hardcore noise stuff. 'What am I interested in releasing right now? Well, aside from my work with White Hand and my various collaborations. I ' m getting very interested in some of the more 'serious ' composer/artists. I"ve just released a tape by Nicolas Collins and I hope to have something in the near future by John Wiggens and maybe Steve Fisk. I'm also still really interested in sound poetry artists and I would like to find more people doing work in that field. 1989 will bring some really elaborate projects from Banned that are being worked on right now . So all in all things look good, as always ...

NO COPYRIGIIT PUBLICATION REPRINT NOWT VITAL 6 Published by: Frans de Waard - Opaalstraat 19 - 6534 XK Nijmegen - Holland. Welcome to Vital 6. Still going strong. We would like to devote a future issue of Vital to women: and especially those women who are NOT working with their friend or husband on a label or in music, but strictly as a solo activity. Send ideas. Thanks to: Jos Smolders. ? name which might be fairly new for the most of you,. i recently got two tapes from blackhumour. and was very impressed by their approach to music. they seem to use only voices, which are edited, and treated with analog and digital devices. the result is something similar to the work of maurizio blanch!, but instead of synths, they only use voices. Apart from his music he edits a "monthly report " with a kind of conceptual writing. reason enough for me to send him some questions concerning himself and his work. l. what can you tell me about your development in music (from music to soundpoetry)? first of all, i want to emphasize that blackhumour is not music. i personally refer to the work I do as "audio-work", which is accurate and earlies no "charge" . some people refer to bh audio as "poetry", which i encourage, or "audio -art", which is fine. it's important for me to have people to understand that this material is meant to be listened to outside the context of any "music" dialog~e. including anti-music. I'm not antimusic, it's just that 1 have no interest at all in add ing to a conversation 1 do not find personally relevant , i.e. music. i am, however, very much interested in poetry and language, and . at its most bas ic level. bh audiowork is primarily about the poetry of language and vice versa, even when it gets terribly abstract. in the first two things we did, "murder" and "trade and commerce", devices played a role, but 1 grew tired of comparisons to "industrial music", which i did not feel i was part of. so i asked myself: whatis the most basic, ordinary sound that i can use, a sound that people hear all the time ? logic dictated the choice of human voice sounds, SO, since 1983, that's all blackhumour has used . if you listen to the "radical positive" release. which both "murder" and "trade and commerce" are on (banned productions), you can hear the development away from effects of any sort - due mainly, once again, to the "musical" connotations ~ffects devices and reverb have. 2. how do you obtain your voicematerial: do you speak any text yourself. do you use taped conversations, or do you steal anything off the radio? i don't like taking things from radio or tv because i don't like the idea of using copyright material. I've only used radio in one short piece in a new series I'm doing, entitled "I'm sorry, she said". i gave it to Jeph Jerman of big body parts for a compilation he's working on. the only other time i've used copyright material was on "breathing like marcel" (corrosive tapes). and that was the screaming from the first haters ep, which i had g.x.'s permission to use. normally. people send me tapes. or. in certain cases. as with th~ pieces "peace in our time" (banned productions) and "prefix" (we never sleep productions}, i will sollicit tapes. recently. i recorded an interview i did with some massage parlour workers in san francisco. and rube using that as the sound-source for a piece rn be giving to banned prod. the reason i don't like using copyright material is that it creates unwanted references back to the source material. rm usually not interested in malting comments about popular communications. so i prefer anonymous sources. i also don·t like infringing on copyright particularly when it's not really necessaxy to do good work. also, radio voices are usually compressed and reverberated, and i won't use found voices that have been electronically doctored. 3. your writings are v~ry difficult to read: what is the meaning of all this? is it meant conceptually? can anything be derived from it by the reader? sure it can. if you consider the blackhumour reports as poetry, like any other form of poetry, you can "read" it on as many differentlevels as you care to. rm very careful about packing as much information as possible into the work i do, and the more knowledge you have in your personal data-bank, the easier the bh stuff is to ·read". you should understand that the writing and reports are not just meant to be perceived in a linear fashion -they·re quaquaversal (going in all directions at once). in the "how" series ofbh reports from '87, mathematical symbols and language symbols are collaged together to suggest operations of calculation. in this way, both languages. the mathematical and the literaxy. can be examined in a different context from where they usually are. and language doesn·t create images - it is images. i like the way words, numbers. and math symbols look. part of the bh mandate is to "think like math", and one of the things i used to say in the reports is "shape that thought". well, the reports are one example of both ideas - thinking like math, and generating thought-shapes. you not only get to imagine the image which is suggested by the languages used. you actually get to experience the shape of the language in and on itself. there's much more to it than that. however, so if people are interested, they should get tn touch with me for a more in-depth explanation. 4. your work is based on loops and/or samplings: what development ls there to be expected ? do you have plans to stop working with repetition ? i never repeat myself. i never repeat myself. i hate to split hairs here. but the work is based on language - looping and sampling are two techniques that i used to address my subject matter and theme. the latest work, "prefix". uses no repetition at all -it's all collage and editing, no samplers. even. the other piece i am working on. "poetry", is a series of short works which have minimal to no repetition. but lots of editing. so i am attempting to get away from repetition as much as possible . simply because i feel as though i've nearly exhausted those techniques and i need to keep the work challenging for myself and others. 5. do you perform live ? yes. we never sleep productions is releasing "performances" which is a collection of the live recordings from 1987, and i'm recording all the performances from 1988 as part of the "entropy in action" series. which may be released next year . last year, i used the live performances as a way of exploring in greater detail some of the ideas that would grow out of the pieces i was working on in studio. this year, however, i decided to have a theme for all):he live-performances, so that each performance of this year, whether it was in vancouver, san francisco, denver or wherever, would be both selfcontained and part of a larger body of work. the live-performances employ the same equipment as the studio work: teac 3440 4 track with dbx noiseredμction, yamaha cassette deck. akai s612 sampler. stereo ampli fication. it sounds like blackhumour . it might not be quite as dense at times. because some 'of the BH pieces have had upwards of 120 to 160 tracks . that's not possible for me to do live at this time. nor am I sure that i want to. even if i did have the resources. generally, the live performances are succes sful in accomplishing what i set out to do. and they're usually well received. 6. do you feel part of a movement of people working in the field of sound poetry ? not particulaxy. i feel kinship with other noise groups, lik('.t:h e haters and m.b. but my rationale for using the human voice is as i've mentioned: everybody hears it all the time, even if its only the voice in their head. so, doing what i do with the voice is one way of illustrating that there is ery little that is ordinaxy or common upon close examination. that's one attitude that infuses all blackhumour work. that's not to say that i don't like sound-poetry - i do - or that i'm not aware of the historical precedents: hugo ball, kurt schwitters, and people who used voice as a sound-source during the '60s. it's Just that my motivations are exclusively personal, and have developed pretty much inde-pendent of the work of others. 7. are you involved in radio ? sure. i'm currently producing new sounds gallery on cfro 102.7 fm in vancouver while g.x. is away in the united states. and fve cohosted that program since 1982, so my involvement in the show goes back a ways. new-sounds is really the only audio-art program anywhere in canada, and while we haven't exactly endeared ourselves to canada 's parallel art community, we've managed, through the years, to bring a very strong presence to the community we serve. a lot of people have had the opportunity to hear some great soundwork that would otherwise be virtually unavailable to canadian listeners. so that's certainly something to be happy with, i figure. maybe a thousand more things can be said about blackhumour and his work. but space is, as always, limited . soi will just mention the releases, plus some of the upcoming releases blackhumour has planned. - radical positive. - ... it was inappropiate (both on banned productions) - regeneration - binaxy (and/or) (both on nihilistic recordings) • exoterica (on we never sleep prod) - breathing like marcel (on corrosive tapes. see reviews) apart from the upcoming tapes which are mentioned in the interview, there will be a 5 tape set on vis-a-vis and a tape on korm plastics. anybody who wants more information about blackhumour, the tapes or the monthly report, feel free to write to: blackhumour 101-1345 west 13th avenue vancouver, b.c. canada v6h ln8 RECORD REVIEWS VIDNA OBMANA/ A THUNDER ORCHESTRA (7" EP on Climax Records). Th1s is a split 7" on a label from which I would only expect a sort of new dance music. But this is altogether something different . As you could read in the last Vital, Vidna Obmana is now making Mechanical Orchestration Music and he is still doing this on his side of the record. What can be said about it? It is still quiet, it is still samplings from classical music, and it is still worthwhile. But I Just wonder when he is coming up with some innovation in his music. Toe unknown 'A Thunder Orchestra' present an obscure statement with references to the bible. Toe music is almost the same as the music ofVidna Obmana. But their last track has a rhythm coming from a rhythmmachine which gives it a popmusic tone, which to me is a destruction of their own concept . A limited edition of 200 copies only! Adres: Climax Productions -Broydenborglaan 2, 2710 Antwerpen - Belgium HNAS - BITrE WERFEN ... (Album on Freedom In Vacuum Records). A record with along title, so I only give the first two words of it. HNAS. a german group, has already made several already made several albums and tapes and I must admit that I was not always fond of their music. I thought that it's too much like Nurse With Wound, too chaotic to be interesting. But what they present on side A is GREAT! Hippie time Is back I A strong rhythm with female vocals and later on an instrumental part. I played this a dozen times already. I forgot to llsten to side B properly. but that side is obviously the weakest part of the record. Nevertheless the best record by these people I have . give us more like this. please . Address: FIAV - 1 Claude ave.#203 -Toronto. Ontario - Canada M6R 2T5 BRUmSTE (doublealbum on RRRecords). On this double album you will find 4 bands which have quite some reputation in the world of avant-garde music: Etant Donnes, Vivenza, Esplendor Geometrico and Pl6.D4. I can be very short about the first 3 of them: what they present here is what you will expect of them. Etant Donnes brtng their shouting and spitting. along with the usual bangmgs, churchbells etc. Vivenza. still is obsessed with machines. Esplendor Geometrico. harsh overload rhythms. Nothing new. Pl6.D4 are the only ones on this record who are able to present a new development in their music. Whilst they started out years ago with freeimprovised music, then going on to quite harsh noise collages. they now have reached a point of where they get a bit minimalistic (no reference however to Steve Reich c.s.). Maybe not of your liking, but then again: it is something new. Address: RRRecords - 151 Paige Str. -Lowell, MA 01852 - USA MERZBOW - I'M PROUD BY RANK OF TIIE WORKERS and MERZBOW - STOREAGE (both onZSF.Produkt). Two new records by the ultimate master of Japanese noise. The first one is recorded in Siberia. at a festival of Jazz & Improvised music in march 1988. The name of the festival can give you a hint of what to expect. Merzbow's music was always improvised. but the adding of a drummer to the total sound. is certainly giving It a much more Jazzy' sound (free Jazz would be a better term) 'or It. The other one Is a new studio record . 11[ore and more Merzbow seems to emphasize on acoustic sound -sources. On this record these are. I think, percussion (although they might not be qualified as drums!. more metal percussion) and large strings of some kind. The result Is, what else would you expect with Merzbow. loud and noisy. Both records are probably released in a small edition only (300 ?), so do not hesitate to get them. Address: ZSF Produkt - l 05 Parkside Corp - 7- 32-14 Takinogawa - Kita, Tokyo - Japan #@$ 11 MAL ELEKTRONISCHE MUSIK AUS MUNCHEN (Compilation on Chaos Sound Unlimited). Electronic music is a term which can be widely interpretated. I guess you find all interpretations on this album. From the use of concrete. daily elements in the compositions from Andreas Merz, K-F Gerber. or Penko. to layered synth noise from G Schroth, Richard Atcher to pumping rhythmmachines from Intoxis . Even a piece of Baroque-like music from Wolfgang Foag. It is all quite diverse in its styles and I considered that a nuisance. Favouring some pieces did not mean a dislike for other pieces. The question remains: who dares to buy an album with so many unknown names ? Address: Chaos Sound Unlimited - Einsteinstr. 104 - VI Munchen 80 - West Germany TAPEREVIEWS MIKE SHANNON - NIGIIT IN TIIE TI-IR.OAT (c60 on Joy Street Studios). This person was unknown to me, until he mailed me this tape . According to the information on the cover Mike uses vocals. guitars, echo. bass. electronics, tapes and keyboards. these instruments lead to a very gloomy and dark music (I guess Mike uses many tape-delays from a tape-deck machine) but on the other hand there Is also very bright stuff. like on the end of side 1. a guitar piece and on side 2 a piece with a rhythm machine and noises. Sometimes a bit industrial-like, sometimes really good. I guess one should check this out. Address: Joy Street Studios - 18 Joy Street - San [Francisco.CA](http://francisco.ca/) 94110 - USA / TIIE HAFLER 1RIO/NURSE WITii WOUND - HIT AGAIN (C45 on Staaltapes) Two of my favourite groups ·working together! An all-time dream. But this ls not an entirely new product by those two. It ls The Hafler Trio at work adding music of Nurse With Wound. And if you take a good listening you will be able to recognize some of the original pieces used. A qulz for the freaks. The result ls a very good collage of sound. But I think that. knowing The Hafler Trio and their mainly 'scientific' approach to sound. this ls not really 'scientific' at all, and brings in a point of questioning whether the theories of The. Hafler Trio are true or not. The cover is nicely prtnted. and on it a new worldrecord in prtnting small letters ls set. Address: Staalplaat - POBox 11453 - 1001 GL Amsterdam - Holland IOSS - JUNKIE ON HISS SNAG (c45 on Midas Music). A new tape by this collaborator on Vital, and like some of the previous a tape with a certain musical theme (his tape Mama dealt with voices). this time it is percussion, mainly influenced by men like John Cage or Edgar Varese (he already wrote pieces for percussion ,n the 1930's). This tape has a piece on it, which is so good, that for this piece alone you have to buy this tape ! It ls called 'Study on Dissonance'. and has a low tone noise, some tinkling metal percussion and women's voices, shivering good (anybody planning a record compilation ... apply for this piece. please). The other pieces are also pretty good, but some seem to lack a good structure, which makes them a bit freaky (I know this sounds a bit vague, but you will hear yourself). Address: Midas Music - Postbus 91 - Asten - Holland (Note: also another new tape is being released at this moment. It ls called 'Corrupted Bellybuster' and ls a re-release from parts of 'I Could Be God' (originally only 15 copies made) plus 3 new tracks . Also on Midas) SWABSOUNDHORROR-ANI'SIRRITDYUM VOL. I (c46 on Ultimate Skin Labs). This ls their third one. and to be fair: it Is their most disappointing one ! Whereas the other two had remarkable good collage music with very funny changes in the music, this one ls virtually based on the use of reverse techniques . Almost everything ls reversed which gets boring at a point. But maybe I should listen to this tape better and more often. This tape ls dedicated to Bagwhan.and this ls no Joke. Address:Ultimate Skin Labs/Art & Noise - POBox 1252 - 6501 BG NiJmegen - The Netherlands blackhumour - breathing like marcel (c60 on corrosive tapes). after the interview introduction we presented in this issue of vital, we can immediately start to review the music, whis is, as always based on voices only. whilst on the previous release (binary, see vital 5) you could hear some voice of some kind, here there isn't anything similar to a voice. the 5 pieces are long pulsating, repetive tracks. the ultimate reference ls the work of m.b. (a guy working with long, monotone synth feedback tracks in the early 80's). but however monotone it sounds, 1 damm like it I address: corrosive tapes - cf o peter moreels - 5 terasse de la madeleine -belglum PIG! KILL! j • . J TIIE HYBRYDS - MYfHICAL MUSIC FROM THE 2 lST CENTURY (c60 on Magthea). This ls music for the so-called Dreammachine by Brion Gysin. After his death Genesis POrridge inherited the dream.machine . but that is something which these people don't know. It ls nice to compare this tape to a tape made by Orrtdge and Andrew McKenzie (The Hafler Trio) with music for the dreamachine . Their interpretation was an hour long pulsating track. a loop or something similar of · noise, with slightly changing tones . The Hybryds made several pieces on their tape. and splitted it into a morning and an evening side. Accoring to their own information they make hypno-ritual music. Sometimes they use african-lilce percussion. processed vocals and lots of strange sounds (refering more or less to animals). The luxurious package includes a blue-print of the [dreammachine.so](http://dreammachine.so/) you can build it yourself. To me this is a better release then the one from Orridge/McKenzie. Address: Magisch Theater Production - Juliaandillenstraat 22 - 2218 Antwerpen - Belgium GAZZA NOVEMBER UNTITLED/ UNFINISHED (2xc60 on Honeymoon Prod.). Thls is the first product from this guy. He works mainly (or better solely) with guitar . On the first of the two tapes older material from 1987 and here you can recognize the guitar as a guitar. He is playing ina very free and improvised style. The second tape is more based on feedback tones, high-pitched and irritating. Personnaly I am favouring the second tape. The package (2 tapes plus booklet in a video box) is sold for only 12 guilders inc post and package, which is not much. Address: Honeymoon Prod. - Spiekmanlaan 4 - 6824 DL Arnhem - Holland THE H~TERS - CONCEPTOLOGY Among the 8 records we mentioned in the last Vital which RRRecords should have released. there are 4 so-called conceptual albums (and more to come). These records are not meant to be played in an ordinary way. but ... what IS their use anyway.Curious as always I ordered these items. To start with the most disappoin ting one: Due Process performing the infamous John Cage piece 4'33 (A piece with no music. only silence). I thought it would have grooves which would last for 4"33, but this silent record doesn't have any grooves at all. The other Due Process record is called Do Damage, and has endgrooves carved into the record on both sides. The album by Billboard Combat looks like the best of all four: it has a lot of rubbish on its surface(grooves are not recognizable). like some razorblades and nails. You can sure play this if you are not particular fond of your rei:;ordplayer. The 4th one Is' by The Haters. and it is a blank record which comes in a plastic bag with sand, to be rubbed into the record. So, now we are back where I started: what to do with these records ? Stick them up my wall ? Play them? What is the concept anyway? To make an art- object or to make a hateful statement about the record industry ? I don't know. Will I becorlle an artist myself if I come up with some concept of using these antlrecords. Upcoming conceptual records by AMK (called Montage) and Kapotte Muziek (Heathen Muzak - ode to NON).

LABELSPOT: SLOWSCAN EDITIONS There you go: I thought I invited the only real sound-poetry label in Holand for this labelspot. then I heared that they are not solely a sound poetry label.SLOWSCAN might a bit unknown to most of you, but this is due to the fact that until now they have operated in another circuit. So what is this sound-poetry about? It is not just poems which happen to be recorded and released on audiotapes. but sound-poetry ls mainly working with voice and electronic equipment (for example) in order to make music. Thus the voice is not used as an apparatus to speak and communicate with, but as a 'real' instrument. The first edition Slowscan released (in 1984) was a tape with several people from around the world being involved in sound-poetry. Among the names you will find John Duncan, Rod Summers, Henri Chopin, Cp.arles Amirkhanian. Somewhat unknown ? Believe me, these are the more well-known guys around in this area. Slowscan's 2nd release already contained music, not sound-poetry. It was improvised music from two bands of the Los Angelos Free Music Society. The third one is with two sound-poetry composers, Larry Wendt on one side and Nicolas Collins on the other.The latest one has already been mentioned in Vital 5. Jad Fair from 1/2 Japanese is playing along on the fourth edition, together with Ant Farm. The b-side is filled by Tom Recchion, who ls said to be playing with The Residents. The first 4 editions were released in an edition of about 100-150 copies. From edition 5 on, this is changed to 500 copies. Also the package (until then a normal tape-box) changes to big sized boxes of high quality. Because of these rather expensive packages. SLOWSCAN had to increase their number of copies. 'Although the market remains very small' ,he admits. His main sales are going to either the USA/ Canada, or to West-Germany and Italy. The big editions however will also prevent the release from being sold out after a short period of time. Traditionally Holland doesn't have many sound-poetry artists ('The dutch language is not good enough ' Slowscan once said in a radio program). The countries where you can find more sound-poetry are Italy. Sweden and Canada (Don't ask me why). On edition 5 you will find on one side an anthology of canadian artists, and on side b some swedish soundpoetry. Number 6 is filled with music by David Roosenboom. It is an anthology of work In the period 1968 to 1984. Thls man makes electroacoustic music using synthesizers. soundgenerators. as well as drums and trumpet on some tracks. Thls tape too is very well documented with a booklet. Another advantage of mixing electro -acoustic music with sound poetry is that people who are getting interested in the music on this label at this moment. will expierence soundpoetry later on. when they will buy the older releases. SLOWSCAN does not have a particular release policy but is mainly interested in releasing stuff of people who are otherwise known from other media, like record or video. and of which SLOWSCAN thinks that they are still exploring the boundaries of sound or music. SLOWSCAN fully admits that there isn't much progress in the field of sound-poetry. Most of the progress that one can see, is the Integration of electronics in soq.nd-poetry . SLOWSCAN also had plans to make a catalogue on sound-poetry, listing all releases related to sound-poetry. , But it seems that some guy in Germany has plans to do so. and so SLOWSCAN dropped this idea (or better. has laid it to rest. because he first wants to see the result from Germany). Well, the last edition which has appeared is one by Ron Kuivila. unfortunally unknown to me. Upcoming is an edition with swedish sound-poetry and edition 9 with music of Gordon Mumma. Mumma has not released music for quite a while now, and SLOWSCAN is very proud to present this new work by him.

NO COPYRIGIIT PUBLICATION REPRINr NOW! VITAL 7 Published by: Frans de Waard - Opaalstraat 19 - 6534 XK. Nijmegen - Holland. Yes. Us again. The ongoing experience. This issue: the historic context. We are still looking for contributions by and about women who compose experimental music, and who are active in any form of organisations (labels etc). Interesting subjects for next issues are also welcome. We had a positive response to our last issue·s lay-out: the costs however are rising, and we would like to ask anyone to send any money to keep Vital alive II Thank you. Thank you also: Ios Smolders for correcting it all and submitting a piece. Next appearance: may 1 SCHIMPFLUCH One day I got a package which. after opening, surprised me very much: the record it contained was packed in a sleeve which didn·t have the usual album size, but which was cut at about 22 cm. On the cover a plastic fork was glued. It read: ·2erstuckelte Denkkurbeln', a title which I am unable to translate. It is the second release by a new Swiss label called Schimpfluch (a combination of a sneer and a curse). It's a compilation-album, but that can not be seen on the record: all tracks on the record are placed in such a way that it looks as if there's one long track on each side. It is a pity that Vital is written in English and probably read by a majority of not german reader/ speakers, otherwise you would have a big laugh at some of the names this record carries: Drangende Hebelkraft, 3 1 I 2 Stempelkissen, 4 Schizoide Musikanten, 0,66 SE, Fam. Pigdog. Together with this record they sent a catalogue with all tapes released by G•Park, plus some of the upcoming record projects. To me this was reason enough to write them for more information. Quotations are from a letter by Rudolv, probably the brain behind Schimpfluch. -nie first idea was the consolidation of artists and anti-artists to produce and distruct art. But because it is difficult to meet with a good response a bigger circle of persons with action- art, the main work now lies on mail-art/ music. Schimpfluch mainly produces and distributes concrete noises like the Wash Your Brains LP, the G•Park tapes etc (see below - ed.)." The maJn inspiration for this label seems to be DadaJsm. This art movement started in 1918, and its principle goal was to ridicule bourgeois society and its dull and virtuous culture. DadaJsts 'stole' official art to re-cut it and present it back as new art. This art-movement (with well known artists Raoul Hausmann. Tzara, Kurt Schwitters) started in the same city from which Schimpfluch originates: Zurich. "Thanks to the actual residence in Zurich (Switzerland) there exists of course a tendency towards Dada. A publication like the MerzJazz tape "(Sch)merz (live)" - poetry and texts from Kurt Schwitters accompanied with Free Jazz - gives reasons for it." Merz-Jazz is from East Germany and they performed here in the west at several jazzfestivals. It is a pity that Schimpfluch didn't include some more info on this band. There is a big difference in styles between the various bands on their compilation. From the very shortcuts of Pl6.D4 to the quite rhythmic efforts of Fam. Plgdog. ·No. we don't try to find new forms of music but we try to conceive a kind of anti- music.· ? • I also got a sticker by Schimpfiuch which says: 'ultimate waste disposal and re-utilization of conventional music'. The re-utilis ati on of daily sounds was Invented in the late '40s in studios in France. Pierre Schaeff er and Pierre Henry composed music in th eir stud io by crucifying a piano, walking up and down stairs and shouting in buckets. But they also abused records and recorded train-sounds. They would pick sounds from the streets, metals or just anything and re-shape it in the studio in to a new piece of music . Some of it was constru cted in a very academic way, pr esented as studies. A lot of the contemporary 'industri alists' . using industrial sounds or any othe r type of noise , are in fact working with the same ideasin a non -academi c way. and some times with interesting results. Environmental sounds are not just produc ed to provoke or to blow your ears ofT: th ey can also be very soft and silent . An example of this can be heard from the Swiss compose r who calls himself o•Park . His music can also be found on the compilation mention ed above and on a compila tion called 'Ecs tacy By Cur ren t' (see Vital 4). G*Park uses sound s recorded in his environment durin g the summer ; during the winter he proc ess es these sounds Into music. Schimpfiuch now has all tapes by G*Park available (total of 5). and we heard the one called 'Zwei Freund e'. Ind eed some of the tracks very obviously contain sounds which can not be made with a music instrument. But in the title piece it seems as if some sort of piano sounds ... Anyway, I don't bother to argue whether or not a piano produces concrete sounds: this tape Is beautiful! The other record we received was by Wash Your Brains. and It had the same sort of cover as 'Zerstuckelte Denkkurbeln' (they seem to work to something of a personal style). In stead of a fork, It comes with a plastic bag of saw dust and tape. The tape Is composed with voices only: a very funny Nurse With Woundlike collage of pure madness. The music on the record combines the best (worst?) of the above. being composed with one long collage of sounds. murmuring, talking, people trying to play in struments. Pure. insane madness . At times these collages have wonderful results. at other times it seems like the sounds are Just randomly put together. which makes it less interesting. The sound quality is poor at times but perhaps this Is the anti music they speak about. Well. as usual with art. statements are also pr esent with Schimpfiuch. Here they are. Think whatever you want about it ... 'After a Jong study about ideologies of persons like Marcel Duchamp. Rene Margrttte etc . we have come to think of the following principles : l . The everyday noises lack singularity and are therefore not dictated by esthetical enjoying sensations. which are responsable for the restric ted limits of music . 2. Owing to the fact that it is named so, the noise becomes music and the choice of the noise depends on the absence of a good or bad tas te. 3. The combination on mathematical accu racy during the combination of the noises tak es the optionality ofT the end-product and leaves the noises thelr reciprocal mutation. Because of that, composition and accident don't work side by side or against each other, but together. Not later than during such a work you come across the result that the music is considered finished and that it looses the significance. ~ Yes. well... I think this label is well worth checking out. and you'd better keep your eyes and ears open for the forthcoming releases. We will give a ttention to the upcoming works on this label (among which a tape In a plastic bag of dirt ... ). Write for a full catalogue to the following address (do not forget the IRC): Schlmpfluch c/o lmvluss Po Box4804 CH-8022 Zurich Switzerland THE ART OF NOISES (Abridged} The historical references of Schimpfluch gives us a good reason to re-print The Art Of Noises manifesto by Luigi Russolo. Most of you people will have heard about It. but have never read it. Jos Smolders selected the interesting parts of it. and added some comments. Dear Pratella, great futurist composer. In Rome, in the C. Theatre. while I was listening to your futurist music, a new art came to my mind, which only you can create: the art of noises. First, the art of music sought and achieved purity, limpidity and sweet ness of sound. Then different sounds were mixed together. taking care to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music is becoming continually more complicated and strives to mix together the most harsh, dissonant and strange sounds . We are coming ever closer to noise -sound . This evolution towards noise sound was not possible before now. 18th century man could never have endured the discordiant intensity of certain chords produced by our orchestras . Still, the limited circle of pure sounds must be broken. For many years Beethoven and Wagner shook our nerves. Now we are satiated and we find far more enjoyment in mentally combining the noises of trams, backfiring motors and bawling crowds. Let's go l We should leave before we are overcome by our desire to create a new musical reality by slapping some faces soundly and discarding violins. piano's and plaintive organs. Let's go ! If we go through a great modem capital with our ears more alert than our eyes, we can delight In distinguishing the murmur of water . air, and gas in metal pipes, the mutter of motors, breathing and pulsing like animals, the throbbing of valves, the thudding of pistons. We can enjoy orchestrating in our minds the crashing of metal shop blinds, the slam - ming of doors. the muttering and shuffellng of crowds. We want to attune and regulate this tremendous variety of noises harmonically and rhythmically. Noise, in fact. differs from sound only in that the vibrations which pro duce It are confused and irregular, both ln rhythm and Intensity . Every manifestati on of our life ls accompanied by noise. Noise, therefore, ls familiar to our ear, and has the power to pull us Into life Itself. We are certain that by selecting, co-ordinatin g and commanding every noise we shall enrich mankind with a new and unexpected delight. Although it is chara cteristic of noise to recall us brutally to real life. the art of noise must not be limited to imitative reproduction. It will achieve it's greatest emotive power In the sheer acoustic enjoyment that the artist will create from combined noise. Here are the 6 families of noises of the futuris t orchestra: 1. rumbles, roars, explosions, crashes . thud s and booms. 2. whistles, hisses, snorts. 3. whispers, murmers, mutters. rumbles, gurgles . 4. creaks, rustles. buzzes, crackles. scrapes . 5. noises obtained by percussion on metal. wood, skin. stone etc. 6. voices of animals and men: shouts. screams. groans. shriek s , howl s , sobs, wheezes, laughs . - Futurist mu sicians must continually enlarg e and enrich the field of sounds. This corre sponds to a need In our sensibility . Moving further and further away from pure sounds . they achieve noise sound. - The limited variety of tones possesed by orchestral instruments today must be replaced by the Infinite variety of tones and noises , reproduced with appropriate mechanisms. -The variety of noises is infln1te. Today, when we have perhaps a thousand different ma chines, we can distinguish a thousand dilTerent noises: tomorrow we will be able to distin guish ten. twenty or thirty th ousand different noises. which we shall not simply imitate, bu t combine Imaginatively. - We therefore invite courage ous young musi cians to continually observe all noises in order to understand the various rhythms of which they are comp osed. After having acquired futurist eyes our widened sensibilities will at last hear with futurist ears . Dear Pratella, I am not a musician and have therefore no acoustical preferences, nor any works to defend. And so, bolder than a professional musician could be, I am unconcerned by my apparent Incompetence and convinced that daring posseseses every right and can open every door. Luigi Russolo, painter Milano, march 11, 1913 After writing and publishing this manifesto. Russolo began to work on his Intonarumorl (noise-makers), whileBalilla Pratella and Luigi's brother, who was a professional musician also started to compose music for orchestra and lntonanimorl. When we hear those compositions today, we are greatly disappointed; the music sounds dull. lt breathes the atmosphere of 19th century salon-music and at its best it's like music for old Frankenstein -films. The intonarumori sound very interesting. though. They were boxes, Inside of which mechanisms were placed, that could produce sounds, like those described In the 6 families of noise. The pitch of the noise could be altered by a lever that was placed on the side of the box. These intonanimort were nothing less than the nonelectronical forefathers of the synthesizer and fairlight- computer. After a few years of reasonable success the futurist music was forgotten, but the Ideas ofRussolo were not. All over the world people lnterpretated the manifesto and composed music that was not (only) based on the classical sound of orchestras, but on the principles of the art of noises as well. Among those were Edgar Varese, Georg e Antheil and John Cage to name a few. This letter to Pratella was the letter-bomb that made music blow away from it's straight Jacket in which it bad been captured for centuries. Jos Smolders/E.A.R.

But due to the fact that Andrew M.McKenzle couldn't find a proper person to read the text In the engllsh language for this record. he decided to put the music on the record and the story on the cover. Apart from the opening of one side, and the closing of the other side, which are quite harsh (it sounds like a synthesizer, but knowing the Haflerl'rio that Is unlikely) most of the music Is very quite. The sounds they use for this music ortglnate from our environment, but due to a dlfficult and a long process of editing, It Is very hard to recognize these sounds as being natural sounds. I find It very refreshing that, although It sounds like the same working process. the result is different from the previous works by Hafler Trio. These previous compositions I associated with short collages, that were placed one after the other. These pieces consist of long. ongoing sounds, with just enough changes to prevent It from becoming dull. A good release. With a beautiful cover! Address: KK Records - Parkstraat 25 -2700 St.Niklaas - Belgium YEAST CULTURE - RENA LEICIA (THE EXPOSITION OF NOTHING)(?" and 10" on Petrt Supplies). This one comes In a very nice package, containing an old 78 record and a 7" with 'music'. Each 78 record is unique, the 7" is the same for the total edition (being 114 copies only). The music on the 7" is noise of a very strange kind: compressed sound, a synth ?, heavily processed record sounds ? I really don't know what it is. Nor do I have anything to compare it with. But it sure sounds fascinating. That's all I can say . Plus that you have to hurry to get one ! Address: Incubator - PO Box 45702 - Seattle, WA 98105 - USA ARCANE DEVICE 3 - FEEDBACK MUSIC (2x 7" on RRRecords). Who would call his music feedback music? You always take a risk to get confused with Whitehouse c.s. Arcane Device 3 proof that It is possible to approach music made With feedback In an innovative way. One 7" is recorded live, and here it sounds like the most of what one can expect feedback music to be . Highpitched tones are replaced by low tones and vice versa. The other 7" Is recorded in a studio, and not only do both sides of the record differ from each other, they're also very very different from the live 7". One side can be compared, In a certain sense, with music that people like Stockhausen and Cage made In the 50s and 60s. The other side starts out as a more or less poppy music, but It becomes extremer towards the end. The only sad thing about this record Is the cover with a person who looks like he Is playing In an SF film. but the records are recommended. Address: RRRecords - 151 Paige Street- Lowell, MA 01852 - USA FUTURISM & DADA REVIEWED (album on Sub Rosa) And again an Item that deals with dada. This is a record that is released by the belgian Sub Rosa-label. Uke Dada For Now, a record that was released a few years ago this new record Is a documentary product. Dada For Now however dealt with the 20s and 30s in a more general perspective. Futurism and Dada Reviewed contains music or soundpoetry by futurtsts and dadaists only. On side 1 we hear Russolo and his intonarumori, Marinettl and Apoll1naire. Side 2 gives us interviews With Duchamp and Tzara, poems by Schwitters and Cocteau singing With orchestra -accompaniment. Of course the sound-quality is at times extremely poor , but when I imagine that the people on this record were the geniuses who made it possible for us to be even able to see noise as a musical element, then I am fascinated. The record Is accompanied by a lot of explanatory notes . This Is truely a very important document for all music-collectors and all those people working with noise-art. address: Sub Rosa - P O Box 808 - 1000 Brussels - Belgium. (IosS) TAPE REVIEWS CITY OF WORMS - WHIME (c60 on Big Body Parts). I never heard of this band nor from this label. But one day I got this release from them, and I was immediately impressed by it. After several times of hearing it I still can't point out anythingwlth which they did make their music. Therelsasortofrhythm(tape-loop.orrhythmbox) and lots of sounds In it, like radio or synths . At times it remembered me of Zoviet France. but, probably due to poor recording equipment, not on their high technical standard. I wonder what would happen if these boys would get a chance to work In the Zoviet France-studios ? Address: Big Body Parts - 3031 E. Platte# 2 - Colorado Springs, CO 80909 - USA. BLACKWOUND -BLOODHOUND (c46on Black Death). The name says It all, probably. Years too late if the Intention would be to shock: this new unkwown band from The Netherlands plays exactly the same that Whitehouse, Sut cliffe Jug end did 6 years ago. After the second wave of the power electronics (Nalls Ov Christ, Victor/Im, Post Destruction Music) there are enough tapes around to destroy your ear. But on the other hand, people stlll pay too much for the rare Whitehouse albums. so if you want the same but you haven't got the money : buy this. Address: Black Death - V.Cleeflaan 1187 - 2722 RG Zoetermeer - Holland MORTUARY ATTENDANT - ANOTHER EMBALMER (c60 on New Flesh Tapes). From a new. small amerlcan label I received this tape . One of their tracks Is called Razorblades. and it seems like razorblades (or scissors) and magnetic tape are the most important Instruments they use on this tape. Words and pieces of music are cut, and repeated, cut and repeated etc. The result reminds me a bit of old Nurse With Wound stuff. Their label, New F1eshTapes. is also compilinginterestlngsamplers . Address: New Flesh - 2837 N.W. 66 Street - Oklahoma City, OK 73116 - USA DAVID PRESCOTT- STUDIES (c50 on Tonspur Tapes) and DAVID PRESCOTT - PRAGUE (c60 on Prlon Tapes) . These are the first lengthy works by Prescott I hear. From what I understood from his intervlewinAudionMagazin e # 9 he ls sort of influenced by the old synth master Conrad Schnitzler and other, more obscure avant-garde musicians. Side A of Studies can be used by other people working with mail music. live actions or radio. As a piece of music to be listened to, It Is too monotonous, without a decent structure. Side B Is a piece for two basses. As a background tape it is very nice music to listen to, not too offensive. The other tape 'Prague· is recorded live and this has some more different musical elements in it. At the base there are slow, repetitive synths, with freaky, melodic stuff. some short wave. and voice sounds. This release is more 'harsh' compared to the other music by Prescott. As a whole it's not really new music, but enjoyable. Address: Tonspur Tapes - c/o Stefan Swab - Eskil tunastrasse Pxion Tapes - c/ o Peter Schuster - Am Roch us Kirchhof 4 - 8500 Numberg 70 - West Germany SWAB SOUND HORROR - ANTS IRRIT DY UM VOL.2 (c40 on Ultima te Skin Labs). The only band who had all their tapes reviewed until now. After the rather disappointingVol. l, I thought Vol.2 would bring us more of the same, but luckily, it didn't . Piano seems to be the new Swab Sound Horror toy. and they (he/ she) knows how to play it. The tape opens with a long piano. with only a few added sounds. Also pretty dominant , at times, ls the voice of their 'leader'. Sometimes with a 'decent' Engllsh accent, or with a 'filthy' American one. With this tape they seem to be back on the road of doing interesting sound collages, like they did on Change Dying (see Vital 4). Address: Art& Noise - POBox 1252- 6501 BG Nljmegen - The Netherlands THE CALL OF MADONNA LUISA CICCONE (c90 Compilation on A/1/1/P). I would like to thank everybody for telling me who Madonna is. nobody read the message in Vital 3 as a cynical joke. The result is now finally released. The names are one big laugh: Psychodonna. Der Gelbe Maradonna. Ciccone Men. Hypnovirgin etc . Most titels of the tracks deal with old Madonna songs. like 'Into The Grave. Into The Groove'. 'Who's That Girl - version', 'Desperatly Screwing Susan' and 'Desperatly Sampling Susan' . Above all I would like to regard this project as funny. Artistically it Isn't high quality. but it's fun. Probably within the next decade most of this will be Jokes nobody can laugh about. because Madonna has dis appeared. But for today, it Is o.k .. Address: Artware: Uwe Hamm -Furholter - Taunustrasse 38 - 6200 Wiesbaden - West Germany MISCONCEPTION Vital is an ongoing experience. I would like to thank all people who give some sort of advice (positive or negative) or help . Also thanks to all people who send in their record or tape for reviewing. As usual you'll get a free copy. But sending me a record or tape does not mean that I will always be positive about It: apart from an objective description of what the product is, I have a certain attitude towards music. I expect people to develop. especially those people working in the area of small labels. where one can (and must) take the risk of doing something new . I do not want more of the same by the same people . Another misconception that people sometimes express: if I put a message in Vital for a compilation. I know nothing more or less than someone who contributes. I get letters saying. this or that was in the Vital, I sent something but got no reply . This is a damn pity but unfortunately not my fault. With this I hope to help a few mis conceptions out of the world . Frans de Waard Labelspot: STAALTAPES DOKUMENTATIE SERIE Staalplaat, the already well-known shop for tapes. also have a label. Until now it seemed as though they were more Interested in releasing well-known names on tape. like Laibach. The Hafler trio and Etant Donnes. But times are changing. They have Just released four new tapes. by fairly un known bands/persons. In the pipeline are many future releases, like CD's by EtantDonnes. MusUmgauze. Controlled Bleeding. The Nocturnal Emissions. a tape and record by Autopsia and a Blackhouse album. But that's for later. Here is a review of the five recent tapes: ENDE SHNEAFLIET - LIVE (c60). This tape contains the only concert this 6 men band ever gave. in a dutch national radio studio . This concert lasted for about half an hour. On the A-side you will find a registration of this. on the b-s!de bits and pieces of the rehearsals for this live concert. For those of you unfamiliar with this group, I can say that the music is electronical with heavy synthesized voice, but it is by no means industrial . It is more like the Residents at times . Probably most of the Vital readers would classify this as too much popmusic (and therefore reject It). A very nice release. that's what I think. FNTC - OPERA (c68). This is a band of four persons (although assisted by master violin player Jon Rose) who did a series of concerts. where the people were blindfolded and told to lie down on the ground. The music (and on some occass!ons the scents aswell) came from all directions. Some people told me that they experienced this as a hippy meeting (I never experienced it at all). but the music on the tape (which is to be heard with headphones) sounds quite interesting: they seem to rely on an improvised style. Women use their voices as an instrument. And all kinds of noises accompany the lot. ENRICO PIVA- DOUBLE BIND (c66). A new tape from this Italian person (see also Vital 5). This Is a more extreme work than the previous 'Four Months Later' . The extreme factor lies in better a short stream of sound. This Is re peated many times on this tape. When I first heard It, I rejected the piece as too simple. But I took a second and a third listen to this tape . and now I'm beginning to appreciate his chal lenging sound. He sure has guts I S.CORE - PRETENSION (c46). Until now I associated this Japanese band with harsh. monotonous rhythm pieces. but this tap e shows quite a change. Thelr music has be come much softer. and one can even discover some oriental influences in this music. I mus t admit that I prefer this new style from S.Core to his old style. His music is richer of tones and spheres. MISSION PAPUA HOLLAND - SON GENG (c53). This dutch band has released two rec ords at the same moment (back in 1987) which unfortunately never reached Vital. One of their records is dualistic: at times It is poppy music, on the other record they present dark synthi collage pieces . On this tape all music Is like the second catagory. They echo almost everything. and this creates a moody, dark sphere. The church bells that are sometimes used, sound like a death march. Certainly not a pleasant tape. yet very well done I All there is left to say is that the packages for these five tapes are the usual Staalplaat plas tic bags. Enrico Piva got a colour printed cover . the other have to do with, also beautiful. colour stencil covers.

**VITAL 8**

NOCOPYRIGHTPUBUCATION REPRINT NOWl. VITAL 8 Published by: Frans de Waard - Opaalstraat 19 - 6534 XK Nijmegen - Holland. Thanks to Peter Duimellnks (forwrttlng some reviews) and Ios Smolders (for correcting and also some reviews). Next appearance: August the 1st 1989. THE HAFLER 'TRIO In 1984 Ha.fler Trio started its existence. Probably due to the fact that Chris Watson (ex-Cabaret Voltaire) was one of its members The Ha.fler Trio received a lot of publicity. But also their 'sctentlflc" approach gave reason for attention. On the first record. 'Bang - An Open Letter'. there are a lot of references to Robol, an organisation for the research on sounds and the effects sounds have on people, and to a researcher called Robert Sprtdgeon, with a list of books he has written. Stlll a lot of people doubt the existence of Sprtdgeon. Other members were Dr. Edward Molenbeek (who gave advices on techniques etc.) andAndrewM.Mckenzie (spokesman, who was also responsible for the lectures he gave in The Netherlands). Because a lot has already been published (mainly through brttain"s music press and a lot of independent fanzines). we suppose that most of the above is not new to you. A few fundamental changes have taken place lately. &fwardMolenbeekdledonaugust the 23rd 1987 at the age of 84 and Chris Watson seems to have disappeared. Andrew M.Mckenzie lives in Amsterdam since april 1987. Since then Andrew has been doing some live performances (The Netherlands. France, Spain), and he was busy with presentations of the dreamachine (see vital 6) and the Hailer Trio released only one record in 1988: lntoutof (see Vital 7). Reason enough to ask Andrew about the present situation of The Ha.fler Trio and how this effects his work . [1b.ls](http://1b.ls/) interview was done partly by mail partly by phone. 1. What can you tell us about the changes in The Hatler Trio, and what the musical conse quenses are ? Who are member now, what is their background ? The Hatler Trio is always changing, so I can"t really say anything too precise about this. At the moment. The Ha.fler Trio consists of myself, but there is always a possibility that this may change in time. We are absolutely NOT concerned with music . I was, in my youth , and have always kept it a seperate interest . 2. You once said that you know all the effects of every sound that you have put into the work of tht. How are you doing this research at the moment since you no longer have any contactwithRobol. I test everything out that I do on myself. With all myexpertences and experience with machines that capture sound in one way or another. and machines that pump it back out again. Further have I not. ROBOL was never that important to me anyway, but I must add that it is not without the bounds of possibility that a sprtdgeon book, or rather a bookabouthisllfeandwork.maybepubllshedin the near or distant future. We were already developing our techniques in the main and biggest part long before we had any contact with Robol. A red herring . 3. A lot of people tell me that they doubt the 6. A lot of people see what the Influences of ex1StenceofSprtdgeonandMolenbeek. What's sound are. What can you tell us about the your comment ? · reactions you get to your work. Sprtdgeon died in 1963 so I never met him. I have met Edward Molenbeek only a couple of times, I have letters from him. What do people expect me to do ? Publish the letters, make xeroxes of his passport ? What ls to be done ultimately to prove he did exist ? It really makes me sick, that still a lot of people need these proves of their existence. 4. I think that The Ha.Oer Trio has a very ldeallstic aim (restoring communication), does this mean that content goes above the form? As to whether content takes precedence over form, I can only say that both are different. One ls not more important than the other, but requires a different set of needs and require· ments. Toe kind ofvaluejudgementlmplicltln yourquestionlsnotreallyapartofwhatwedo. We spread certain Ideas (mainly to make people aware of the fact that they are lnfluenced on a subconsious level by sound), but we are not that naive to think that lt will change this situation. Toe kind of sounds on the records and tapes Is not that Important to me, as ls the whole ldea of making records etc. 1bls ls the commerdal part of what we do, and it really doesn't interest me at all. 5. A lot of people see tht as a musical group, would lt therefore be possible to see your sound lnfonnatlpn as aesthetically beautiful. I think a lot of people will buy your materlal because of its aesthetic qualities. (paradox) There ls of course, no REAL paradox in that people find what we do 'beautiful', but using that word invokes such an enormous amount of subjective phenomena. that it Is Impossible to make any kind of statement about it. If people want to see us as a 'music group' fine. Or anything else for that matter. The very act of releasing a record, or doing any kind of work in the public arena. involves the strong possibility, and virtual certainty, that it will be misinterpreted. The effect is, to a certain extent though, always within our control, created. as it is, by objective means . I'm not really interested in reactions to anything. Any responses to what we do have always dealt with on the level that they arose or were directed upon. This ls their particular business. ls always an ongoing situation, and is the most positive aspect of what we do. It ls not really to be des~bed in a postal interview. A lot of people contact me, and I'm always willlng to listen and answer, even when I am supposed of doing something else, which may seem of much more Importance. Answering questions are of equal importance with making a record sleeve. The Hajler Trio in Arnhem (1988) (PhDt.o by Freek Kinkelaar.I 7. Now that a lot of your ideas are well-known, would lt be a logical step to make specially composed music (like music for study of healing) ? Why (not) ? Your question about changing what we do as a reaction to something that happens ln another sphere ls rather baflling. What we do changes as a result of circumstances which affect us, not those that are artiflcally created by those that know better than to sleepwalk through life. building theories stolen and built upon others. 8. Ustenlng to to your records one can hear a lot of the same sounds ? What is the meaning of this? ·If a sound la repeatefdro m one record to another, I find this normal. Is lt strange that for fifty years that Frank Sinatra has sung with the same voice, in the same language (and probably in the same suit) ? The sounds that I use are like words to a storyteller. Or a hammer for a carpenter. A tool. As contexts changes in which they are placed, the meaning changes of these sounds. 9. But don't you want to use new sounds, to stay original ? The fact that you have to be original in order to be Interesting, ls what I called a 'western disease'. Very much unlike the situation ln the east. where the story is much more Important than the words (which are tools to tell the story). 10. Please tell us about your recent'interest and involvement ln the Dreamachlne of Brion Gysin? After the death of Brion Gysin Genesis P.Orrldge inherited the Dreamachlne but because of lack of time, he gave all the rights to me. The Dreamachlne project shall shortly be released on KKRecords (Belgium), consisting of a book, a record, a CD, and Dreamachine kit. It is the most easily available and effective method this time to directly apprehend the workings of the creative processes of the human brain. It Is probably the ultimate creative tool, and It ls scandalous that we have had to wait thirty years for it. The sound application has . been completed by Genesis P.Orrldge and myself, and is the first step in making further researches into the propeties of the Alpha waves present in relaxed or connective creative states. 11. Other plans and releases ? Apart from the release of The Dreamachlne, Ignotium Per Ignotius was released with a book on CD by Touch at the end of February (see elsewhere ln this Vital). A CD called Moods & Events is planned for KK. plus a 78 RPM record called Maar. The Hailer Trio Play The Hailer Trio is now being put together and the entire HaflerTrio catalogue is due to be rereleased on CD in October of this year. 'Seven Hours Sleep' , parts 6,5,4,3.2 & 1 making the completion of the cycle, each part with new lnstalment of the story and packaging by Ben of Zovtet France. Further more F1lm Soundtracks and Installations over Europe, and possibly flrther afield. Soundwork for live Psychic 1V shows. Sound work for Etant Donnes. And lots of other delights. I hope that I have been interpreting my notes on the telephone conversation right and it Is most likely that Vital keeps an eye or two open for the further activities of The Ha.Oer Trio. In case you might think that still a lot remains unanswered, remember that in order to tell -you something you 'must stop the white man's habit of asking questions . The Ha.Oer Trio can be contacted bywrlting to and sending an IRC or stamp to: The Hailer Trio Alexander Boerstraat 30 1071 KZ Amsterdam The Netherlands RECORDS / CD'S REVIEWS CAPTURED MUSIC (Compilation album on Selektion) and Pl6.D4 • ACRID ACME (OF) Pl6.D4 (CD on Selektion). Two interesting new releases by Selektion. At the Captured Music Festival held in Karlsruhe (February 1987), electro-acoustic music of the 50's and 60's was confronted with modem music-productions. Toe cut-up technique ln Its different ·developmental stages and the problems of authorship (e.g. sampling), were the leading themes of the festival. The Captured Music LP ls not a live documentation. As basic material, and as a continuation of the festival's themes the live recordings of Nicolas Collins, The HaflerTrio, Christian Marclay, Nachtluft, Pl6.D4, Psychic 1V, SBOTIIl, Elliot Sharp and Asmus Tietchens were used. On side one Pl6.D4's cut-up technique, allows the listener to recognize the basic material"s inherent structure. Side two shows a further transformation of side one, by As· mus Tietchens, SBOTIIl and Nachtluft. The conceptual idea is Interesting (as are most of the other Selektion releases. remember Nichts Niemand Nirgends Nie), but does this mean that from a purely musical point of view, this record is worth buying ? I think It does . especially side twow, hich ls quite dJverse, ls a real treat. and I really enjoy listening to that side. Diversity ls also charactertstic of the Pl6.D4 CD. It ls dJvtded Into 4 main sections: Section 1 i 19811 with three pieces, consists of material recorded In 1981 and recomposed and treated ln 1987. Section 2 il98T) with five pieces, features Pl6.D4 compositions presented at the captured Music festival. rearranged with two pieces. Section 3 ("Musique Concrete Improvtseej consists of two pieces. As the title lndJcates, these pieces are Improvised dJrectly to tape. Section 4 ls by Pl6.D4 and Merzbow and ls one piece. A collaboration of these two groups, entitled ·zur Genese der Halbbildung". Not only do the sections differ from one another, also does each piece within a section have its own particular sound. Because ofthe use of several production techniques, each track sounds new and refreshing. Although the CD lasts for 61 minutes, I never got bored Ustenlng to lt. which ls usually the case with lengthy pieces. Of course I have my favourite track, which is the Pl6.D4/Merzbow piece. They managed to come up with a totally new sound, and not as I expected a Pl6.D4 piece comb1ned with a Merzbow piece. If you still haven't got a CD player, this is a perfect good reason to buy one, for this CD is not to be missed. Address: Selektion - Monchstr. 25 - 65 Mainz 26- RFA(PD) THE HAFLER TRIO· IGNOTltJM PER IGNOTIUS (CD on Touch). I always felt that music by, for Instance, Nurse With Wound or The Hatler Trio would be at lts best when released on CD Instead of easily damaged vinyl. "That scratching is making met itch•. And yes, here lt ls, the first CD by The Hatler Trio. ·1p1 was initially Intended to be released as a three r box set with booklet. But r records usually are of very bad quality. And this must be one of the reasons that 'the IPI project now has been released on CD. The music (?) itself ls not that much different from what we have heard of the last few records, with maybe as exception 'Intoutof (see Vital 7). But what makes it really interesting, is the sound quality. Usterung to it is not easy. At times you 'hear' only silence (no scratches, no noise, Just silence), is the disc over ? No: suddenly an enormous avalanche of sound roars from your loudspeakers. with, an Impact only possible on CD. As is usual, this release Includes a booklet (32 pages). The whole text ls in reversed writing, which makes it very dJfficult to read. In fact I didn't even trouble myself, decoding the text with a mirror. I assume that basically all Hafter Trio texts are the same. And it doesn't have any Influence on me when I listen to the music. Texts like these (about different forms of alchemy?), merely help to create or maintain the hafler Trio's scientific aura. Another interesting detail about this release: the CD isn't packed in the usual plastic box. but in a beautifully designed booklet (20 at 13 cm). Address: Touch - 13 Osward Road - London SWl 7 7SS - England (PD) TAPE REVIEWS PRINTED AT BISMARCK'S DEATH • ALCHIMIE DU SON (C60 (no label)). I first came ! across this name in a fanzine and their sound : was described as 'Nurse With Wound or Hatler Trio interpreting Stravinsky', which of course . , is a very interesting combination of two ex' tremes. A few weeks ago I received this tape which has been recorded live in 1988. Side one ...,. . is very rhythmic, with a very clear singing ' ~ . .' voice. Superficially listened to, one would easily describe It as rockmusic. But you can ·also dJscovcr the sound of a tinkling piano and this gives the whole a more 'experimental' Idea (well, relatively). Side two ls more · noisy, dJstortion are full open. Whitehouse is a name which comes in mind. The concert ends in Stravinsky's Rites Of Spring and this ls, for me, the only reference It has to Stravinsky. Nurse With Wound or Hatler Trio? I don't see It. The result ls interesting enough to try and get hold of more of this. Address: Heiko Mutert - An der Bracke 44 - 7145 Markgroningen - RFA CRASH WORSHIP - THIS (C45 on Rocco Fresco). 1llis is the first time I heard something of this group from the USA. and the quality in presentation. recording-quality and music is outstanding I Their music Is mainly percussive and has a ritualistic character to it. But there ls also a great dJversity in their music: 'Madon' has a sophisticated use of feedback, 'Karezza" a hippieflute I 'Rainbird' is danceable. For those of you who want a name to compare, I guess 23 Skidoo would be most likely. 1llis tape comes in a beautiful colour cover and with a booklet. It seems that these people have released records and other tapes. which will be worth checking out. Address: Rocco fresco Prod - 1949 Riviera Dr - Vista. CA 92084 - USA BORA AUREA (C60 Compilation on AK Tapes). AK Tapes ls one of the few labels in Austria and it exists for 5 or 6 years now. Their releases (musical aswell as visual) seem to emphazise on the ritual, magical and occult side of life. Hora Aurea means something like 'the golden hour'. Some names are wellknown, like Vox Populi, Kadmon and Luciano Dart, others are unknown, such as Dependance, Allerseelen and Place Of Clod. Some of the bands Involved use rhythmic elements. Allerseelen use a trumpett sound and a rather simple synth melody, but without sounding boring. Well, the first 6 or 7 minutes of the Aside are filled with absolute beauty: Mental Measuretech, unknown until now, have some sampled vocals ' and a very nice marimba sound . A magntflcent piece, worth buying the whole tape. Address: AK - c/o Petak - P.O.Box 778 - Al O 11 Vienna - Austria THE MASTER MUSICIANS OF JOUJOUKA/ BRION GYSIN -BACK IN NO TIME (2C60's on Staaltape/ dokumentatleserte). The long announced release has flnally been brought to daylight. One tape (one side only) contains an interview with the now deceased Brion Gysin, the famous artist who was a good friend of William Burroughs and who lived in Morocco for 23 years. In the interview he talks about his friend Jean Genet (French writer), his daily life, his friends and other things. To me he seems like a very funny person. he is remarkable witty. The other tape is closely connected with Gysin, because during his stay in Morrocco, he heard the music of The Master Musicians. He liked it so much that he wanted to hear it every day of his life. Their music is based on very long ongoing pieces which can put you in a state of trance. They also had a great influence on a band like 23 Skidoo. Drums and pipes are the ingredients they use . Fascinating stuff, recordings are made in France by Etant Donnes. nus package comes in a specially designed wooden box and a very good bound book by Andrew M.Mckenzle about the person of Brion Gys1n. An excellent release. Address: Staalplaat - P.0.Box 11453 -1001 GL Amsterdam - The Netherlands GREGORY WHITEHEAD - PLEASURE OF RUINS (C ?) USA soundcomposer Whitehead has a general interest in the use of words and language. Wordplay used to be his main issu e but for some time now he ls occupied by language, words and their associative environments. 1b..ts tape, for Instance: deals with ancient ruins but their ancient mystery ls also placed in auditive snapshots of adventurous films and radio plays (look, I've found something ... .1t's, . .it's .. alivel). POR ls less complex than some of his previous tapes but it still kept me listening to it again and again to decipher the story that lies hidden In the Intricate composition. address: ART EAR - 312 Caselli Av. - San Francisco - CA 94114 - USA (IS) PRILWS LACUS - DENTRO DE LA GRAVEDAD (c42 on V2) DdlG ls PL's last cassette. It is not to be listened to by adults and comes In a disgusting PURfoam cover (goodbye ozone- · layer). So far the negative part. And I haven't said anything about the music, yeti The music is an attempt to communicate emotions Ooy, anger, grte.t) with abstract means. This ls very tricky business and more often than not leads to disastrous results. But I must say PL have succeeded in creating a good balance that ls acceptable. sometimes agreeable, and most of the time even enjoyable . There ls a lot to be heard. Every magnetic particle of the tape has been used which makes it dilllcult to hear it through in one go. but you'll certainly want to hear it all. Ask them to leave the cover ofil BOOKS REVIEWS CULTURE POST MORTEM (book published by Karsten Wolf). Fanzines usually give topical information. At the moment when a fanzine is released. the information ls already out of date. It is therefore very hard to discuss a larger movement. or to speak much more In detail about persons or activities. Books must. because they are more expensive to produce. contain information which ls valid over a longer period, so that ls still worthwhile reading after 5 years. The few people who do understand this are the editors of the excellent RE/Search books., Years after reading for Instance Toe Industrial Culture Handbook' still contains a great impact on people who read It. A similar lnitiative comes from Karsten Wolf. You might know him as the publisher of the magazine Politechnlcal Subway Research (see Vital 4). He now says that the form of PSR didn't fit.any longer in what he wanted and he therefore has edited a book In which he presents some forms of underground culture, I.e. the performance group Das Synthetlsches Mischgewebe. and action artists like OU Blo, Mark Pauline and La Fura Del Baus, musicians like Foetus and Einsturzende Neubauten. filmmaker Nici{ Zedd and the organisation Staalplaat.

The copy I have ls xeroxed and unfortunately the book ls written In german (which ls. I guess, unfortunetaly for the most of you). JOERG THOMASWS - TOMATO (C45) Thomasius ls a musician from Eastern-germany which made me suspicious about the music . Experimental music from behind the iron curtain I used to associate with hippie's · playing some sort of heavy Jazz-music. I played the tape, and to my surprise I liked it very much. It ls music of a refreshing originality. Sounds and noises are used In a musical way, which is something that cannot be said of much of the experimental music that rve heard lately. At times the music reminded of the early-residents music but by far the largest part I Just enjoyed listening to. address: JoergThomasius -Auguststrasse 19 - 1040 Berlin - DOR (IS) Nevertheless It is a must for anyone who can read german and who ls interested in some background information.

Box 837 - 5000 AV Tllburg - Holland labels pot: BIG BODY PARTS In the previous vital you could have read this name for the first time, and now they already fill the labelspot. In a relatively short period I got many tapes, which are packed in a simple, direct way (black and white xeroxes), but With a strong musical impact: tapes by Hands To sound harsh, a direct attack on the ears, but also Innovative. City Of Worms (COW from now on) ls about the same, but not as harsh. more in the :Z.OvieFt rance: style. Within three weeks I got a very nice letter explalning all I wanted to know, so apart from adding some comments myself, labelboss Jeph Jerman speaks to you: ·mg Body Parts Productions was started by me in december 1986 to release cassettes of bands I am involved in (being COW and Hands To - ed.) and other local projects. To date we have released over 50 tapes. I started the label because there wasn't much interest from other people in releasing our work and I decided to do it myself. My criteria for releases ls Just anything which l think is well done and which interests me. Mainly, music or sound work with some concrete idea behind it. not just music for the sake of making music. In conjunction with Alamut Records (run by Lance Burton) we have begun releasing records because we can now afford it. and many people stlll take albums more seriously than tapes. Also the money made on album sales goes back into the label to help and finance other projects. Many more albums are In the works, including a Hands To Ip sometime this year". The first record was a re -issue of the long deleted Whitehouse album A Date With Destiny (previous editlon of 200 copies on Rectifier). one side recorded in Denver 's Slaughterhouse and one side in Roebuck In London. A performance ended by the police: it Is all on the record. Also live in the second one, with recordings from the Haters, the title being Tractor, and it ls out now. ·Hands To ls my solo project which deals mainly with the effe'cts of sounds on the body/ mind/psyche. without the listener knowing the origin of the sounds. All sounds used are highly charged emotionally, being sounds of specillc events (le, dogs attacking. cannon shots. car crashes. body sounds etc). I am trying to find out if people can feel the emotion of the e','.ent. even though the sounds of the event are disguised and heavily processed/ mixed. COW differs only slightly from Hands To In that Cow·s music is usually more rhythmically oriented , thus making for easier assimilation by the listener. Also, Cow is a group. consisting of myself and my partner George Ericson, so there ls much more to give and take and discussion of our ideas. In live performances. Cow uses film and video works to disorient the audience and to try and cause a sensory overload.· Big Body Parts also prints magazines (one by the name of Afterbirth) and puts on performances by such artists as The Haters. lliusion Of Safety and Eric Lunde. In the summer of 1988 BBP participated in Lunde 's Colorado Terrain Investigation and helped In the performance which this Investigation cumtnated In. They are also on the boxed set 7" released from this work (an excellent release on RRRecords. try and get a copy of it), and we sell a video tape of the performance and other Lunde's works.

 VITAL 9 Published by: Frans de Waard - Opaalstraat 19 - 6534 XK NiJmegen - Holland. Now we are entering our third year of existence with a lot of changes: we have decided to publish Vital from now on bl-monthly, and you can subscribe to it. 10 dutch guilders for 5 Issues Inside Europe or 7 US Dollars for the same 5 outside Europe . This is much cheaper than sending us 2 IRC's per issue. Another change is that we now have 4 people who write regulary for us: Peter Duimelinks. Anton Viergever. Ios Smolders and yours truly. We hope to serve you with the most actual and vital infor -mation which others fail to give you in such a short term . Also we like to know from everybody who Is copying Vital. how many copies she/he is making, because we want to have some more insight In the circulation of our work . Thanks to Freek Kinkelaar for corrections.Next appearance: october the first 89. ERIC LUNDE Since about half a year or so this name is getting quite famous. So far he has released 3 T's on RRRecords and more recently an LP on Alamut Records . His work seems to be something special: it ls a mixture of hard electronics (feedback). distorted vocals (or better spoken text). perf ormances at obscure sites (such as old Indian places) and an overload of written material . Lunde Is also known as a member of the group Boy Dirt Car . but that area of his work ls not of our interest here . There are plans to get him over to Europe for some performances. An introduc tion into his person and his work seems neccessary. 1. From what I understand your solowork ls more like a performance than a conven tional music-concert ? What can you tell us about these performances and their contents? Recently . my body has been the central staging area and reference point for my work. With XCHdX. the body was confined (and at some points . grafted) within a metal skeletal structure and given a task . which was the repetition of a movement. the prophecy refered to in the title of the work (and the Ip - reviewed elsewhere) . The ta:.k was a simple pulling and relaxing of cords latched to points on the metal frame and to a grid suspended over a prone and buried 'other'. a body of another human. the ter rain. Another perfor •r•.l'Emance, 'Hym' (which was less succesful in execution and result) dealt with projection through shadow. mimicry. and tracing of the 'other· .The major concern and theme of recent performances has been the question of being, of human beings. and of being in general. And a speculation on a possible mode of being in light of our recent existen tial shift. in terms of our technological ad vances and our specie atrophy . What I pursue Is an authehtic theatrical experience of this shift. a theater of cruelty for our con temporary experience of being, existence. self and life (I should add, this is the goal . the expectation. it Is yet to be fulfilled). within an information-excessive social structure and the metaphysics of the infor mation/ excessive society which has developed with It. A double for it. not to enter into it. but to stand outside it and within life itself, to affirm life in an arena of life which would comment on the sphere of the simply living, that living dominated by the informa tion excessive and the metaphysic .Yet. to remain non-representational. I never place meaning ln the action and language of my work. in that there ls some slgn to be decoded for meaning. I feel that the performances are languages in themselves. In terms of an active hieroglyphics of the body. the terrain lt Is placed ln. and the positing and reposltlng of the body. terrain and sense objects (sound. light. smell. tactile). In most cases. I perceive meaning after or during the performances. never really prior to the experience. l suppose l should shout my discov eries to the audience as the action proceeds. l would say that a noticeable change in my pshyche. in my relations to my body, to my being human. occured after the first XCHdX presentation. l enjoyed being part of the frame. being changed by the frame . 1 felt a larger strength which exhibited itself throughout the days following the events. I think it has permanently altered my perception of life. I often desired to return to the frame . l still desire to return to it. 2. 'Eros ion· is a term which is used a lot in your records. but l think it is a negative metaphor. Do you agree? No. 'Erosion ' is not exclusively negative. nor is it exclu sively positive. My use of ·erosion ' tends to be metaphoric, but it in itself is not. l feel the use of erosion is similar to it's existence as a force in our universe (a force that has lost it's privilege. for l don 't think we allow ourselves to think about it). It is neutral. It is not either/or . good nor bad . as an acti ve force in our world . it is always at work. it tears down one site and uses what it has torn. the material of that s ite. to build upon another site . It removes and displaces . but replaces. It is an active double force : it removes and replaces, it destroys and it construc ts. And it is always at work. 1 think because of it's double nature . I have adopted it as a central theme. because with erosion recording . that is what you do : you destroy one sound to build another sound with the elements that remain. Regardless of conten t. value and meaning . Whether it's good or bad . Although. 1 do wish It would act on some undesirable elements in our soc iety. and the sooner the better .Let's put it this way: eros ion is the silent killer. But it is also the silent creator . It is also . and will be. natur es/the earths ultimate vengenace upon the idiot/man. For those reasons. I don't think the naturalists have to worry about it too much. Erosion Is very life affirming (Although, lately, the recordings have revealed another side. and that ls of cloning, duplication of duplicates. the possibility of ·repltcant degeneration' etc, which is all very appealing to me). 3. One slde of the Aztalan EP was recorded at an artgallery, do you feel connected with the 'official' art movement. Why (not) ? No. 1 don 't feel part of the official art scene at all. Nor do I want to be part of it. What did appeal was getting grant money, but then 1 would have to be official and answer to the state of Wisconsin and the US Government for that money. Also. galleries are as worthless as nightclubs . They both have their incestuous offspring, their sexual favors for display space. their red tape and regulations which makes both highly unappealing . 4 . Your work also seems to be quite theoretical (unlike most other things from the USA). do you agree and what responses do you get to your work? I have always taken a theoretical approach to my work and towards life. And I place great value on the thought behind a work. Theory Is fiction and rooted in imagination. Theory is the spark of invention . It is the sidecar of strategy . In the US there is a complete lack of this urgency, something I find disstressing. An urgenr.y which theory provides. What I get from the US Is puzzled indifference. From Europe. puzzled inquisitiveness. 5. I read something about a new set of work called 'Enhancement of the body '. What ls it about? Simply, it's improving the image body. enhancement of the form. It Is temporarily becoming inhuman. Now. with the new Re/ Search , the three volume 'Fragments For The History Of The Human Body', stelarc etc. the terrain of the body is becoming a concern, under the gaze of art. science, theory and every mutation between . Whereas the Re/Search cronies are statisfied with some fulfillment of sensual pleasure through negation of body function. a pleasure In the pain of the body meet or seperate. 1 am concerned with being human. of pointing out the failings of the human and working from the body to achieve a physical experience of the body . From there . I th ink one could arrive at an improved body. a body that would be completly physi cal and material. Where I seperate with the Re/Search body modlfication-ists is their spiritual valuation of the self/body. I would like to see man achieve full body function : a completly materialist body. a body free from duality and hierarchial structures and metaphysics. To feel the body with body, and to feel the soul with the body and not with the soul, the feeling of entrapment. On the other hand . I run counter to the current rage (especially here in America) of atheticism . of running , weightlifting, the total human body conditioning . I am rather inclined to say that much more could be achieved through cybernetic prothesis, Implants. circuitry etc . A much more fulfilled body . I am very far from achieving this. but I think that more important than the actual development of this new technological body. is the establishment of a working philoso phy towards this body. I am more engaged in this. in a relationship to technology . of a philosophy and world view which is cable ready and cable which is not christlan. 6 . Assuming you've never been to Europe. what do you except to find here. what will you be doing here (performance wise::). I have not been to Europe. I am not sure what I would be doing. I could say. it would be very stripped down. possibly backing tapes, slides. video (no full body proth esis. too cumbersome. expensive). some tape ersoslon/ cloning, spoken/broken word.I would hope to find Europe very alien, by which I mean. I would like It to be completly different and new to me. I've always enjoyed experiencing and recalling the initial experi ence of a new site. an unfamiliar territory . Thats really all I would hope for. and hope to find. Unchartered territory for the body of Eric Lunde. 7 . Can you inform us about other plans you have? I have begun working with samplers and midi interfacing with drum machines and macintosh computers . A completly new experience. Translating my•r•ersosion work to disc (all three LP /EP releases. cassettes) is an alien experience I am enjoying . Like transferring my central nervous system to a computer. I plan on investigating computers with the same theories I investigated sound with . So far. the results are exhilirating. Gibson 's Cyberspace has started to become tangJ.ble to me.I guess. I would like to build myself a new body . For now. I am rehabilitating the XCHdX suit with skin. veins of electrical wire . weapons and a central power and information gathering unit. Making all the functions I do with two hands accessible by movement and one finger. 1 know this : this much is possible for now. Also. I'm preparing a couple of publications which I've been working on for sometime . Details forthcoming . Vital will, as always. keep an eye/ ear open regarding new work of Eric Lunde. and report about it in future Vitals . For those who want any specific information write to Eric Lunde . Add an !RC for a reply . Eric Lunde P.O. Box 93241 Milwaukee WI 53203 USA ASMUS TIETCHENS Part Three by Frans de Waard In Vital 2 and 3 Dolf Mulder wrote a story about this German composer. Since then a lot of new material has come about. so an update is necessary. Part two ended with the announcement of 2 upcoming records. 'Aus Freude Am Elend' (Dom USA) and 'Nottumo· (Discos Esplendor Geometrtco). Both these albums use e.xclustve soundsources. the first one uses vocals and the latter only piano sounds. Tietchens treats the sounds in the studio using all kind of equipment. and when you thus hear the results it is sometimes very hard to recognize the original sound material. Although both albums use conventional soundsources. it gives a clearifmg e.xample of the evolution which one can find in Tietchens work: the studio is an important instrument for the contemporary composer. Quite an odd release from Tietchens is 'Linea· (Konn Plastics). his first cassette release since 1985. Originally this should have been released on Trance Port Tapes (but they went broke ). then on Ladd/Frith (they didn't like it). and so it was finally released 4 years after recording. 1'wo long linear compositions \JJith synthesizer and rhtyhm. Highly mimimal music. just when you think it is only a tape-loop. there are very little variations. Reactions to it vary from e.xtreme enthusiasm to extreme rejection of the tape. and nothing in between. The split album on Odd Size ('Face To Face'), one side by Tietchens and one side by Die Form is mentioned in Vital 5. so it's not mentioned here. Most of the Tietchens albums are produced by Okko Bekker who owns the Audiple.x studio. where Tietchens records all his. works. Together With Bekker an album was made. 'E' (Dom). The 6 pieces on it differ very much from each other: there is for example an improvised piece for bassclarinet and tape, a marimba piece and an orchestral piece. The record comes (limited) with a T' with solo pieces by Bekker and Tietchens. The most recent work by Tietchens ls a new record on Hamster Records. It is the second in a series of four ('Watching The Burning Bride', recorded together With Terry BurroWs was part 1. and part 3. a new solo record by Burrows. is out now) and it is called 'Abflelschung'. No less than 20 pieces on it. and it all seems to be recorded with the use of concrete sounds . but heavtly treated, so that these sounds cannot be recognized. Like I said above, this also seems to be another logical step in his work, but this time he Is not using any conventional sounds. While writing this. I know that there are more releases to emerge this year. but I feel it is better to give names and labels when they are released. A complete list of all Tietchens work (inc. compilations) can be obtained from Vital. Send an !RC! RECORD/CD'S REVIEWS Lately we did receive a lot of albums (we always do receive a lot of cassettes) and we cannot review them all. We made a selection of what we think ls interesting and give a short list. plus addresses of the others. Otherwise there might be no room for our tapereviews. which we don't want ... COLLECTIVE FOIST (Album From Foist Magazine). What goal do compilations serve? This is a tricky questi on: what's the use of having the lOOth track by group X on a compilation Y? On this compilation you will find very unknown groups from the States. With an overall good musical quality. it varies from sampled vocals to african-like music. Some names which can be found here: Deco. Deerpark. Lilacs. M.L. Quebed, Dinosaur, Health and Beauty plus much more. This record is especially recommended to all people with an adventurous attitude towards music and really interested in new names.Address: Foist Magazine - 287 Averill Avenue - Rochester. NY 14607 - USA SBOTHI & MERZBOW - COLLABORATIVE (Album and 7" on Extreme). These two have started a serie of collaborations of which this is the first offshoot. It seems that our friend Merzbow has adepted some techniques which are commenly used by SBOTHI: short cuts. fragments of sounds. SBOTHI uses his own short -cut techniques in a way he has been developing from his previous album 'and' on. I find it very hard to describe the collages these two guys have made. For reasons I don't know. I like SBOTiil's side more than Merzbow's: it seems to have more dynamics. while Merzbow seems to stay on the same volume. Nevertheless this release is worthwhile to buy.Address: Extreme - PO Box 2627X - GPO Melbourne - Victoria 3001 - Australia RUNZELSTIRN &: GURGELSTOCK - BEI ABWESENHEIT .•• (Half Album. Half Object on Schimpfluch). The object part is a piece of sandpaper glued to the albumside which has no grooves. Needle destruction for sure! On the music side there is only 1 track. One•r•long collage of sounds. similar to the work of SBOTHI. But. probably due to the fact that you can recognize some sounds. it is more humourous. One of the sounds which I found out was the famous car crash sound from the Haters. but there should be more. A record recommended to those who love the more harsh form of musique con crete (what do you think of the term Noise Concrete ... ) Address: Schimpfluch - c/o Imvluss - PO Box 4804 - 8022 Zurich - Suisse ERIC LUNDE - XCHdX, TERRAIN OF PROPHECY (Album on Alamut Records). Elsewhere in this Vital you can read about this person and his work . Side A starts off with feedback distorted vocals. machine noise and ticking sounds (clock?). This goes on and on. The vocals get stronger (clearer) towards the end of this side. Side B has a similar track of about three minutes. ending in a lockgroove. The rest of the vinyl is used for an etched drawing of [Lur.de](http://lur.de/) hanging In his body machine. I find Lunde's music the best 'power' electronics I've heard in a while. because it is combined with performance and written material and not plain noise. Address: Alamut Records - PO Box 1444 - Colorado Springs, CO 80901 - USA MUSLIMGAUZE - IRAN (CD on Staalplaat) Finally the first CD release from this dutch cassette (and record) label. In the past ten years more than 90.000 people got killed in Iran. so I don't see any reason at all to admire that country's politics like Muslimgauze does (the fact that they have other ethic values is no reason for killing other people with other ideas!). Although the cover gives only three tracks. once you hear them you will discover that each track has more tracks within them.

Cthulhu is a small label concerning the number of their releases. but what they release is always very professional packed. Their main interest seems to be a kind of 'gloomy', "ritual' music . For me it was the first time I heard music by Ain Soph. and I was quite surprised not to hear synths and vocals and above all tons of echo. Medieval like vocals and flute in "Es tey' and organ and vocals in 'Retrowange Novelle'. I think they have a new approach to a kind of mus.ic wh.ich otherwise leads to flogging a dead horse. Sigillum S (also Italian) gives an example of what I said above : lots of echo. vocals which sound like 'popmusic". Not that good, but fll guess many who will like Ain Soph. will like the other side too.

IEP as a label started in 1983 and so far I have released about 30 tapes from people like Comando Bruno, Merz (his own musical effort with friends - ed.). Recursos Ajenos.

The latter was a compilation dedicated to sound poetry and audio poetry . It came with a booklet in a plastic bag. Personally I think that is one of my best releases to date. because the theme is approached differently by people like Giancarlo Toniutti. Esplendor Geometrico . Fracisco Felipe.

Vital is proud to present its first face • to face interview. At a big fair 'Europe Against The Current' (see also elsewhere) we met J.M Onni of Le Syndicat and we decided to do a kind of improvised interview, not only about Le Syndicat, but also on his other works with Entre Vifs and La Sonorite Jaune. The name of Le Syndicat may be well known to a lot of people, because they appeared on numerous compila· tions. They also have released about 16 tapes with their own music, mainly on their own label, La Procedure (formerly known as Le Syndicat). The music of Le Syndicat is a noise orgy; harsh feedback, music to blast your ears off. But: it never bores (at least so do I think). Sometimes you can hear shortwave sounds mixed through it. The covers and other artwork are almost always the same: futuristic lettertype, and pictures of the most awful diseases. Another activity, which J.M. Onni promoted at the fair was a shop in Paris, called 'Les Ets. De Phonographics De L'est' (from now on to be called Les Ets.), where a lot of independent music is sold. 1. When did you start working with music and what did you do? When we started in 1980, we made much noise and for this purpose used all kinds of machinery. It was really low technique. So about 1985 we changed more to the so-called Hardcore electronic music, which many people know from us. We have just released a new tape called 'Macisto Fuzztanz' and again there was a change in the sound. We now use a lot of rhythm, but it is still very powerful. We call this new direction 'Panzerbeat'. 2. Why change the sound? This is because the members of Le Syndicat change. We don't have any specific musical style. But it is always powerful. Speedmusic ... We start with just noise which becomes music. Now we work with synths and samplers, but in the past we also worked with badly switched tapedecks, which made an awful amount of noise. Entre Vifs differs from Le Syndicat in the sense that Entre Vifs uses a lot of self-built instruments. These self built instruments are a kind of wires and the sound is lead through special Well, now it is time to have J.M. speak ... Onni · effects. These instruments are built by Zorin, who is also an ex-member of Le Syndicat, and are perhaps a bit No, these records will be released by influenced by Luigi Russolo (see other people and not by us.

Another activity of yours is the (laughs). shop, This shop also organises per· formances. What can you tell me 8. What about performing live? about that? Entre Vifs would like to play more live, because it is easier for them to do things. Their music is more impt'ovised. For Le Syndicat perform· ing live is more difficult. It needs more equipment and production. Well, the shop is the only one in Paris where people can buy indepen· dently released music. We also do concerts and expositions, but we don't have much money. So we cannot pay for travel expenses etc. But a possibility is that anyone who I hope I have interpretated my notes is planning to go to Paris sends us of our conversation correctly. You get information about her/his activities two addresses here, and for contact and maybe we can organise of Le Syndicat and of course one something for them, maybe together from the shop: with parisian bands. LA PROCEDURE . 5. In France there is a large music scene, what's your opinion on their activities? There are indeed a lot of people doing music and releasing tapes, and I think that's good. There seems to be just one problem: there is a lot of competition between the people, which is not good, because the circuit is very small. It's better to work together, then to fight each other. 6. Le Syndicat will release three albums. Does this mean a farewell to audio tapes? 178 Bis, BLD. De Montmorency 95170 Deuil France The shop is located at: Les Ets.

'Suture Self' is an album with the complete music for 57 minutes lasting videofilm. The origins of the visual material comes from all kinds of sources, like footage made by the members of VATS. The music is often very quite and on other occassions very hektik, rhtyhmic. But it doesn't sound like one would expect from a band who says that they do improvised music, it all sounds more structured. To the music texts are read by St. Deborah from writers like Burroughs, Beckett, Blanchot and 'Penthouse Letters'.

### TOOL Two 

#### Description

Interactive experience which jumps the gap between the physical magazine and the music. It is to embed the graphics of the magazine with information – the music so that when you hover on them you can hear music associated to the images taken from the original printed magazine.

#### Methods

Same as **TOOL #1** for getting the scans. Then we extracted and edited all the graphics with photoshop. First we searched for the music in [discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) page and then on youtube and we used a Youtube to mp3 [converter](https://ytmp3.cc/en13/) to get the audio files. We created a interactive playlist in Atom coding software by using html, javascript and css.

# Mastercopy and distribution

Reproduction and distribution was and still is very important part of the magazine concept. The original version was sent to subscribers via post. These people received a so called **Mastercopy** and were encouraged to continue distributing the magazine by making copies of the Mastercopy. Today Vital is sent to subscribers via e–mail.

- We want to create a distribution network by using torrents – a peer-to-peer sharing system. Once we complete our transcodings, we want to package them into one file and make them available to everyone via torrent. Thus, maintaining the principle of a master copy. Everyone will become part of the chain.

# Outcomes

Environment which allows you to browse the content (all the tools) and understand its origins.

This environment will be accesible via website.

# Questions and problems

Before the COVID–19 situation started we wanted to make physical transcodings, which would create physical environment. It is the life work of someone and creating a physical/ tangible space transcodes the paper magazine into more immersive experience as it is for the person making it. By making this environment we wanted to connect the viewer/listener more closely to the person who is committing his life to creating this magazine.

Now the task is to transform this environment into digital space.
